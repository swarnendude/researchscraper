is a senior reporter covering technology, gaming, and more. He joined The Verge in 2019 after nearly two years at Techmeme.

Humane is selling most of its company to HP for $116 million and will stop selling AI Pin, the company announced today.

AI Pins that have already been purchased will continue to function normally until 3PM ET on February 28th, Humane says

in a support document

. After that date, Pins will “no longer connect to Humane’s servers.” As a result, AI Pin features will “no longer include calling, messaging, AI queries / responses, or cloud access.” Humane is also encouraging users to download any pictures, videos, and notes stored on their Pins before they are permanently deleted at that shutdown time.

The Humane AI Pin never had a chance

Humane AI Pin review: not even close

After the shutdown, offline features like “battery level” will still work, Humane says, but “any function that requires cloud connectivity like voice interactions, AI responses, and .Center access” will not.

Humane will only offer refunds on AI Pins that are “within the 90-day return window from their original shipment date,” according to

an FAQ about the shutdown

. Refunds “must be submitted by February 27th, 2025.” If you have paid for a Humane subscription past February 28th, Humane says “..we will process a prorated refund.”

Anyone who had been waiting for a replacement charging case following

its recall

will “automatically receive a refund for the portion of your original purchase price that was allocated to the Charge Case after February 28, 2025.”

HP is buying Humane’s CosmOS, bringing on Humane technical staff, and will get more than 300 patents and patent applications, Humane says

in its press release

.

Ahead of the AI Pin’s official launch, Humane hyped up the device with an onstage demo at TED that left us

with a lot of questions

and a reveal video that it had to update

to address a big error

. The Pin finally launched in April 2024 to scathing reviews;

The Verge’s

David Pierce

said that

“it just doesn’t work,” and MKBHD called it

“the worst product I’ve ever reviewed.”

Humane reportedly started looking for a buyer

shortly after the launch of the AI Pin

at a price as high as $1 billion — a lot more than the $116 million acquisition price announced today. And the AI Pin appears to have sold quite poorly, with

The Verge

reporting in August

that daily returns were outpacing sales. Humane cut the price of the Pin

in October

.

And while Humane did end up adding some new features to the

AI Pin’s CosmOS software

, the company also appeared to be

attempting a pivot

to positioning CosmOS as an operating system other companies could put into their gadgets and devices.

Bloomberg

reports that

“Humane’s team, including founders Imran Chaudhri and Bethany Bongiorno, will form a new division at HP to help integrate artificial intelligence into the company’s personal computers, printers and connected conference rooms,” per an HP executive. The new team will be called HP IQ, which will be “HP’s new AI innovation lab focused on building an intelligent ecosystem across HP’s products and services for the future of work,” according to

an HP press release

.

## ✓ What to Do With Your Defunct Humane Ai Pin | WIRED

As of today, the Humane Ai Pin is dead—less than a year since its launch. Following an

acquisition by HP

, Humane shut down many of the core features of the artificial-intelligence-powered wearable and deleted user data, rendering it useless. Yes, some functions remain, like checking battery life (useful!), but you can't access the voice assistant.

If you spent $700 on an Ai Pin, you might be wondering what you can do now. These are the risks of being an early adopter, but not getting a refund on a device that’s been bricked before the warranty is even up feels like a rip-off. Humane sold

roughly 10,000 units

, though

daily returns were outpacing sales

at one point, so there are even fewer Pins in the world. Still, that's thousands of effectively useless devices. It's a blip in the

amount of e-waste

generated in a year

around the world

—already at

a crisis point

—but Humane really should have offered a more responsible approach with the Ai Pin's demise.

There might not be a way to get your money back, though. If you bought the pin in October of 2024 (for some reason), you might fall under the typical

120-day window to issue a chargeback

with your credit card. There are some alternative options, however. Let's explore.

File a Complaint With the FTC

Killing a product consumers have spent money on is “unfair and deceptive.” That's what Lucas Gutterman told WIRED via email. He's the campaign director of the Designed to Last campaign at

Public Interest Research Groups (PIRG)

.

“When we buy something with advertised features, we should get what we pay for, and when we get ripped off the law should protect us,” Gutterman says. “I urge everyone who purchased a Humane AI Pin to file a complaint with the FTC so they can step up and protect consumers.”

Photograph: Federal Trade Commission

Last year, a coalition of groups like US PIRG and Consumer Reports

sent a letter to the Federal Trade Commission

, urging the agency to address “software tethering,” described as the use of software to control and limit the function of a device after someone buys it. The FTC subsequently

conducted a study

that attempted to determine software support commitments for more than 180 products, only to find that “nearly 89 percent of the manufacturer's web pages for these products failed to disclose how long the products would receive software updates.”

Humane's

warranty states

that the “software and software functionality” are excluded, which is often the case on many connected products. But the study also noted that it's deceptive if manufacturers market a device's features but then fail to provide software updates to maintain those capabilities—it may violate the

Magnuson Moss Warranty Act

, which was enacted in 1975 to protect consumers from unfair disclaimers in warranties.

“Without transparent labeling of length of software support, or by taking away key features that were advertised, manufacturers might be violating the FTC Act by deceiving consumers," Gutterman says. "Paying for a $700 product that's supposed to work, and then being told it will suddenly stop working, is a ‘harm consumers cannot avoid,’ although it's one that Humane could have humanely avoided before they shipped e-waste to-be."

You can file a

complaint with the FTC here

.

Pressure Humane to Open Up the Software

Sometimes, when companies stop delivering updates to products and shut down core features, a devoted community comes to the rescue to revive or maintain capabilities of the product (or mod it to do something else). We've seen this time and time again, like with

the iPod

, the

Game Boy

, or even the

Pebble smartwatch

.

The Humane Ai Pin may not have enough doting admirers up for the task, but this process would be made simpler if Humane released the keys to the software. Kyle Wiens, CEO of iFixit, says Humane should follow Pebble's lead and open the device up. Either that or we'll have to wait for someone to find a vulnerability and jailbreak the Ai Pin to write custom software for it. Humane did not respond to our request for comment.

Instagram content

What could you do with this little wearable pin? Wiens had some ideas. “You could just use it as a Walkie-Talkie … a pin that talks to the internet, has a camera and microphone, sounds pretty cool. It's like a

Star Trek

communications pin."

Dispose or Disassemble It

If you want to just get rid of the thing, Wiens says, make sure you remove the battery first and then take it to an e-recycler. We also have a detailed guide on how to

responsibly dispose of your electronics

. Make sure you do the same for the other accessories that came in the box, though you can easily repurpose Humane's nifty charging adapter and the

nice braided cable

.

Alternatively, you can use a service

like Grid

and have the company deconstruct and frame the Humane Ai Pin, so you can hang it

is The Verge’s senior AI reporter. An AI beat reporter for more than five years, her work has also appeared in CNBC, MIT Technology Review, Wired UK, and other outlets.

OpenAI has scrubbed mentions of io, the hardware startup co-founded by famous Apple designer Jony Ive, from its website and social media channels. The sudden change closely follows their recent announcement of

OpenAI’s nearly $6.5 billion acquisition

and plans to create dedicated AI hardware.

OpenAI tells

The Verge

the deal is still happening, but it scrubbed mentions due to a trademark lawsuit from Iyo, the hearing device startup spun out of Google’s moonshot factory.

The announcement blog post and a nine-minute video featuring Ive and OpenAI CEO Sam Altman are no longer available. The blog post from Ive and Altman announcing the deal said, “The io team, focused on developing products that inspire, empower and enable, will now merge with OpenAI to work more intimately with the research, engineering and product teams in San Francisco.”

OpenAI spokesperson Kayla Wood:

This page is temporarily down due to a court order following a trademark complaint from iyO about our use of the name ‘io.’ We don’t agree with the complaint and are reviewing our options.

...challenges and opportunities this time with unique headwinds

One more piece today on my recent series on upcoming

AI Smart Glasses

and

AI Devices

from

Amazon

,

Meta

,

Google

,

Apple

and others, ramping up in this

AI Tech Wave

. These are new,

AI Native, non-legacy devices

beyond smartphones and PCs, to make

new AI applications and services

possible beyond today’s AI chatbots.

One more company in the mix of course is

OpenAI,

post its

$6.5 billion+ acquisition of io,

founded by former Apple uber-designer

Jony Ive

.

I’ve been

discussing for a while

that

new hardware and software is HARD

, in every major tech wave. And AI is no different.

Both Amazon and Apple have had

very visible public delays

in their plans for AI powered Alexa/Echo and Apple Siri/Home devices for months now. It seems that OpenAI has some challenges it’s sorting through as well in its AI Devices planned for next year and beyond.

The Financial Times (FT) discusses these issues in

“OpenAI and Jony Ive grapple with technical issues on secretive AI device”

:

“ChatGPT maker is working with former Apple design boss to launch a palm-sized personal assistant next year.”

“OpenAI and star designer Jony Ive are grappling with a series of technical issues with their secretive new artificial intelligence device, as they push to launch a blockbuster tech product next year. The San Francisco-based start-up run by Sam Altman acquired the former Apple design chief’s company io for $6.5bn in May, but the pair have shared few details on the projects they are building.”

“Their aim is to create a palm-sized device without a screen that can take audio and visual cues from the physical environment and respond to users’ requests. People familiar with their plans said OpenAI and Ive had yet to solve critical problems that could delay the device’s release.”

The challenges and decisions faced by OpenAI outlined below, are applicable to most companies large and small developing new AI devices:

“Despite having hardware developed by Ive and his team — whose alluring designs of the iMac, iPod and iPhone helped turn Apple into one of the most valuable companies in the world — obstacles remain in the device’s software and the infrastructure needed to power it.”

“These include deciding on the assistant’s “personality”, privacy issues and budgeting for the computing power needed to run OpenAI’s models on a mass consumer device.”

“Compute is another huge factor for the delay,” said one person close to Ive. “Amazon has the compute for an Alexa, so does Google [for its Home device], but OpenAI is struggling to get enough compute for ChatGPT, let alone an AI device — they need to fix that first.”

“A person close to OpenAI said the teething troubles were simply normal parts of the product development process. Multiple people familiar with the plans said OpenAI and Ive were working on a device roughly the size of a smartphone that users would communicate with through a camera, microphone and speaker. One person suggested it might have multiple cameras.”

The meagre available specifics

hint

at the

contours of the device:

“The gadget is designed to sit on a desk or table but can also be carried around by the user. The Wall Street Journal previously reported some of the specifications around the device. One person said the device would be “always on” rather than triggered by a word or prompt.”

“The device’s sensors would gather data throughout the day that would help to build its virtual assistant’s “memory”. OpenAI overtook Elon Musk’s SpaceX to become the world’s most valuable private company this week, after a deal that valued it at $500bn.”

In this effort, OpenAI is executing on a well-worn plan for new devices in most prior tech waves:

“One of the ways the ChatGPT maker is seeking to justify the price tag is a push into hardware. The goal is to improve the “smart speakers” of the past decade, such as Amazon’s Echo speaker and its Alexa digital assistant, which are generally used for a limited set of functions such as listening to music and setting kitchen timers.”

A unique differentiated challenge this time is that AI is increasingly being anthropomorphized (aka humanized) by mainstream users. Something that needs to be addressed in a first principles way in product design and the eventual mass market UI/UX (user interface and experience):

“OpenAI and Ive are seeking to build a more powerful and useful machine. But two people familiar with the project said that settling on the device’s “voice” and its mannerisms were a challenge. One issue is ensuring the device only chimes in when useful, preventing it from talking too much or not knowing when to finish the conversation — an ongoing issue with ChatGPT.”

“The concept is that you should have a friend who’s a computer who isn’t your weird AI girlfriend . . . like [Apple’s

Humane’s Ai Pin Shutdown – Unfair to Customers!

I purchased the Humane Ai Pin around $1,000 on 9/20/24, expecting an innovative, long-term device. Five month later, Humane is shutting down all services, making the device completely useless by February 28, 2025.

What’s worse? They refuse to issue refunds, even though:

- My original order was never fully fulfilled. The charger case was missing due to safety issues, and I was forced to wait 3-6 months for it.

- When they finally offered a refund or a 3-6-month wait , I chose to wait—but now, with Ai Pin being discontinued, I’m stuck with nothing.

- Despite my order not being complete, they are using a 90-day policy against me!

No Refunds for a Dead Device?

Humane refuses to take responsibility, hiding behind a strict 90-day return policy, even though the device is being bricked far before its expected lifespan. This isn’t a customer’s fault—it’s a failure of Humane’s business model, and paying customers are being left with expensive e-waste.

SAN FRANCISCO (AP) —

A budding partnership

between OpenAI CEO Sam Altman and legendary iPhone designer Jony Ive to develop a new artificial intelligence hardware product has hit a legal snag after a federal judge ruled they must temporarily stop marketing the new venture.

OpenAI last month announced it was buying io Products, a product and engineering company co-founded by Ive, in a deal valued at nearly $6.5 billion.

But it quickly faced a trademark complaint from a startup with a similarly sounding name, IYO, which is also developing AI hardware that it had pitched to Altman’s personal investment firm and Ive’s design firm in 2022.

U.S. District Judge Trina Thompson ruled late Friday that IYO has a strong enough trademark infringement case to proceed to a hearing in October. Until then, she ordered Altman, Ive and OpenAI to refrain from “using the IYO mark, and any mark confusingly similar thereto, including the IO mark in connection with the marketing or sale of related products.”

OpenAI responded by scrubbing its website of mentions of the new venture, including a web page of the May 21 announcement.

In its place, the company had a message Monday that said the page “is temporarily down due to a court order” and added: “We don’t agree with the complaint and are reviewing our options.”

IYO CEO Jason Rugolo applauded the ruling Monday in a written statement that said the startup will aggressively protect its brand and tech investments.

“IYO will not roll over and let Sam and Jony trample on our rights, no matter how rich and famous they are,” Rugolo said.

What if Jony Ive, through his company I.O., partnered with OpenAI to build an AI device — what’s the one feature it must have?

Imagine a collaboration between Jony Ive’s design vision and OpenAI’s AI capabilities. Not a phone. Not glasses. Something entirely new.

If they built a personal AI device from scratch, what’s the single most important feature you’d want it to have?

## ✓ The State of AI: Global Survey 2025 | McKinsey

The state of AI in 2025: Agents, innovation, and transformation

November 5, 2025

| Survey

Almost all survey respondents say their organizations are using AI, and many have begun to use AI agents. But most are still in the early stages of scaling AI and capturing enterprise-level value.

(30 pages)

Key findings

Most organizations are still in the experimentation or piloting phase:

Nearly two-thirds of respondents say their organizations have not yet begun scaling AI across the enterprise.

High curiosity in AI agents:

Sixty-two percent of survey respondents say their organizations are at least experimenting with AI agents.

Positive leading indicators on impact of AI:

Respondents report use-case-level cost and revenue benefits, and 64 percent say that AI is enabling their innovation. However, just 39Â percent report EBIT impact at the enterprise level.

High performers use AI to drive growth, innovation, and cost:

Eighty percent of respondents say their companies set efficiency as an objective of their AI initiatives, but the companies seeing the most value from AI often set growth or innovation as additional objectives.

Redesigning workflows is a key success factor:

Half of those AI high performers intend to use AI to transform their businesses, and most are redesigning workflows.

Differing perspectives on employment impact:

Respondents vary in their expectations of AIâs impact on the overall workforce size of their organizations in the coming year: 32Â percent expect decreases, 43 percent no change, and 13Â percent increases.

Three years since the introduction of genÂ AI tools

triggered a new era of artificial intelligence, nearly nine out of ten survey respondents say their organizations are regularly using AIâbut the pace of progress remains uneven. While AI tools are now commonplace, most organizations have not yet embedded them deeply enough into their workflows and processes to realize material enterprise-level benefits. The latest McKinsey Global Survey on the state of AI reveals a landscape defined by both wider useâincluding growing proliferation of agentic AIâand stubborn growing pains, with the transition from pilots to scaled impact remaining a work in progress at most organizations.

AI use continues to broaden but remains primarily in pilot phases

Our latest survey shows a larger share of respondents reporting AI use by their organizations, though most have yet to scale the technologies. The share of respondents saying their organizations are using AI in at least one business function has increased since our research last year: 88 percent report regular AI use in at least one business function, compared with 78 percent a year ago. But at the enterprise level, the majority are still in the experimenting or piloting stages (Exhibit 1), with approximately one-third reporting that their companies have begun to scale their AI programs.

Many organizations are already experimenting with AI agents

Organizations are also beginning to explore opportunities with AI agentsâsystems based on foundation models capable of acting in the real world, planning and executing multiple steps in a workflow. Twenty-three percent of respondents report their organizations are scaling an agentic AI system somewhere in their enterprises (that is, expanding the deployment and adoption of the technology within a least one business function), and an additional 39 percent say they have begun experimenting with AI agents. But use of agents is not yet widespread: Most of those who are scaling agents say theyâre only doing so in one or two functions. In any given business function, no more than 10 percent of respondents say their organizations are scaling AI agents (Exhibit 2).

Looking at individual business functions, agent use is most commonly reported in IT and knowledge management, where agentic use cases such as service-desk management in IT and deep research in knowledge management have quickly developed. By industry, the use of AI agents is most widely reported in the technology, media and telecommunications, and healthcare sectors (Exhibit 3).

For most organizations, AI use remains in pilot phases

Reported AI use ticks upward in nearly every industry

In every industry

besides the technology sector (which had already exceeded 90 percent reporting AI use), the share of respondents saying that their organization is regularly using AI in at least one business function has meaningfully increased since our previous survey. In last yearâs research, respondents working for technology companies reported being ahead of other industries with respect to their use of AI. Now, respondents in media and telecommunications and insurance are just as likely as those in tech

## ✓ I did 100 interviews for 4 AI products. It was slow and expensive—so I built FirstSign - Indie Hackers

**URL:** https://www.indiehackers.com/post/i-did-100-interviews-for-4-ai-products-it-was-slow-and-expensive-so-i-built-firstsign-7d27ca5c3d

Hey founders,

I've launched big products (TikTok and SoundOn) where feedback is abundant: quant + qual everywhere. But when I started building niche AI products (Humva, LensGo, AdsDog, UseLyra), I ran into the opposite problem: too many ideas, too few users, and very slow learning loops.

So I brute-forced it: 100 user interviews across 4 products, thousands of dollars, and weeks of recruitment/scheduling/calls. Helpful—yes. Scalable for tiny teams—no. That's the moment I wanted a faster, cheaper first pass to sanity-check a concept before committing weeks of build time.

What I built

FirstSign: paste a one-sentence idea, get a decision-ready 1-pager in minutes: product angles, segments & ICPs, interview questions + answers. The goal isn't to replace real customers; it's to replace the first 5–10 exploratory interviews when you need directional signal to move (or kill) an idea.

How it works (short)

1.	You drop a one-liner (problem, audience, feature).

2.	FirstSign spins up synthetic interviews and a simple checklist to pressure-test the concept.

3.	You get a compact readout to guide next steps (what to test, which users to chase, what to ask).

What I'm testing now

•	Does this help founders change their next step within 24 hours?

•	Where does it break (certain verticals/personas)?

•	What data/format makes the readout truly decision-ready?

Ask

Founders: drop your one-liner in the comments and Ill run 3 free fast passes and share redacted results in-thread. If you prefer hands-on GTM talk, happy to jam—this is my home turf.

Or give it a spin —

## ✓ Why AI Pin failed: A lesson for startups | Uttam Gupta posted on the topic | LinkedIn

They said it would replace your iPhone ❌

Instead, it crashed a 7,000 crore company in under a year.

Founded by ex-Apple engineers, raised 1,900 crore in funding, and promised to change how we use technology.

But today?

It’s selling for just 960 crore.

Here’s why this AI Pin failed—and what every startup should learn from it:

1️⃣ A Ridiculous Price Tag

👉 58,000 upfront + 2,000 monthly fees.

👉 For something that couldn't even beat a basic smartphone.

2️⃣ No Real-World Testing

👉 Terrible battery life. Slow AI. Voice commands that barely worked.

👉 Even budget phones do better.

3️⃣ Burning Cash Too Fast

👉 They spent like a unicorn with no backup plan.

👉 When users rejected it, there was no way to recover.

But here’s the BIGGEST mistake:

They built a “perfect” product instead of a useful one.

No apps. No ecosystem. No seamless connection to tools we use daily.

Just a cool-looking gadget that no one needed.

🚀 The real lesson?

Startups don’t fail because they lack innovation.

They fail when they ignore what customers actually want.

Would you spend 58,000 on an AI Pin? Let’s discuss 👇

You see this AI pin? It was made to replace your iPhone. Instead it killed a 7000 crore company in less than a year, started by ex Apple workers, got 1900 crore funding and promised to change how we used it. But now they're selling for just 960 crore. Shocking, right? Here's why they failed and and it's a lesson for all of us. First, they priced it at 58,000 + 2000 monthly fees. Second, they didn't test it properly. Bad battery life, slow AI voice commands that didn't work. Even our basic phones work better. Third, they spend money. Too fast with no backup plan. When people didn't like it, they had no way to save the company. Here's what most people miss. These big company people try to make a perfect product instead of a useful one. No apps, no links to other devices, no way to use it with services we actually use daily. Just a fancy gadget that couldn't be the phones we already have. The biggest lesson? This is exactly how most overhyped startups fail, while smart companies focus on what customers really need. Would you spend 58,000 on this AI pin? Tell me in the comments. Follow me for more useful startup lessons.

The ₹7,000 Crore Crash: A Masterclass in Startup Failure

The AI Pin is a textbook case of why even the most hyped innovations crash and burn. The data doesn’t lie:

90% of startups fail, and 34% of them do so because they built something nobody actually wants

Only 0.01% of VC-backed startups become unicorns, but most implode due to poor market fit and cash burn

Apple, Google, and Samsung spend years testing products before launch. This AI Pin? Rushed to market, underdelivered, and overcharged.

Why It Flopped (and What Every Startup Should Learn)

❌ Price Tag Nightmare – ₹58,000 + ₹2,000/month = No incentive to switch from a smartphone.

❌ Tech That Didn’t Work – AI was slow, buggy, and unreliable—even basic budget phones perform better.

❌ Cash Burn, No Recovery – Spent VC money like a unicorn but forgot the golden rule: survival first, scale later.

❌ No Ecosystem, No Adoption – No apps, no integrations, no real-world utility.

Lesson?

Startups don’t fail because they lack innovation.

They fail when they ignore what customers actually want.

Innovation Without Purpose Is Just Expensive Art

Build for real needs, not just innovation.

Price for value, not perception.

Test in reality, not just labs.

Listen to customers before spending fortunes.

The world rewards solutions, not just technology.

An 'always on' OpenAI device is a massive backlash waiting to happen

If the thing ever gets made, it will be like Google Glass all over again, but worse

Last week, the big tech news was that

OpenAI had acquired Jony Ive’s design studio

in yet another deal worth so many billions of dollars,

to build

some vaguely defined “AI devices.” While the announcement itself was void of meaningful information about the apparently forthcoming products, details of OpenAI’s plans and what the they’re supposed to look like soon started leaking out.

As those details leaked, all I could think about was how much people are going to hate these things. If an OpenAI hardware product ever does launch, there’s going to be plenty of, let’s say, rather justified hostility towards them. An OpenAI-branded device might make the public vitriol spewed at the Google Glass—which was banished by backlash for a decade—tame by comparison.

According to the

Wall Street Journal

, Altman told OpenAI staff that the incoming device won’t be a phone or glasses, but that it will be portable and always on, to gather data about its users’ environment, and, of course, that it will be a phenomenal success: Altman

said

it will add $1 trillion to OpenAI’s value. He also said that the products, which he referred to as “companions,” will ship by the end of next year, and that they will sell them “faster than any company has ever shipped 100 million of something new before.”

The supply chain analyst Ming-Chi Kuo, meanwhile,

reported

that according to his research, mass production is expected to begin in 2027, and that

3. The current prototype is slightly larger than the AI Pin, with a form factor as compact and elegant as an iPod Shuffle…

4. One of the intended use cases is wearing the device around the neck.

5. It will have cameras and microphones for environmental detection, with no display functionality.

6. It is expected to connect to smartphones and PCs, utilizing their computing and display capabilities.

The self-described AR/VR/AI Content Creator Ben Geskin

made an AI-generated design mockup

using the above details, which looked like this:

Obviously, this is not a rendering of the final product, or even a prototype of the product, it’s one guy on social media sharing an AI-generated image (which, humorously, he watermarked). But it’s effective enough at conveying what an always-listening, always data-collecting OpenAI device would be, so it’s been passed around social media a good deal since. Surprise, people hate it.

For good reason:

Now, this is still mostly speculation; some reports are saying it will be worn like a necklace, others that Ive doesn’t want it to be a “wearable,” others just that it will be a “third device” in addition to your phone and computer etc etc etc.

But given what we do know—that it will always be on to receive data—and will necessarily contain instruments to collect that data—microphone, camera, sensors— it is safe to assume that it will be a surveillance machine of considerable proportions. So that’s one strike against it right out the gate, and a valid reason for people to reject its very premise; ChatGPT collects user input to train its models already, now just imagine that everything you hear, see, or say becomes training data owned by OpenAI.

If you’re old enough to remember the debut of Google Glass in 2013, then you’re old enough to remember one of the most pronounced bouts of public backlash against a tech product in the 21st Century. Early users of Google Glass—the search giant’s augmented reality glasses—were dubbed

Glassholes

and endlessly mocked on

social

and

regular media

. In particular, people

recoiled

against

the idea of normalizing a device that allowed them to be photographed or documented against their will. The device flopped among developers and early users, too, and that public outcry, and the sense of utter rejection of Glass it stamped into popular culture, basically banished the very concept of such a device for nearly a decade.

A lot has changed since then, of course. There’s a case to be made that courtesy of other “always on” devices like Alexa, Ring, and a decade-plus of total smartphone saturation, public to
