Anyone building an “Agent platform” with LangChain + LangGraph or other framework?

I’m trying to design an

Agent middle layer

inside my company using LangChain + LangGraph. The idea is:

One shared platform with core abilities (RAG, tool orchestration, workflows).

Different teams plug in their own agents for use cases (customer support, report generation, SOP tasks, etc.).

Basically:

a reusable Agent infra instead of one-off agents.

Has anyone here tried something similar? Curious about:

What worked / didn’t work in your setup?

How you kept it flexible enough for multiple business scenarios?

Any best practices or anti-patterns with LangGraph?

Agentic AI projects are likely to fail at a rate far higher than currently predicted and present a major challenge to cybersecurity operations, according to an information security expert.

Haider Pasha, EMEA CISO at Palo Alto Networks, told

ITPro

that the benefits of

agentic AI

would be outweighed by the risks if

chief information security officers (CISOs)

don’t employ strict strategic and technical controls over the technology’s deployment.

Gartner predicts

40% of agentic AI projects will fail by 2027

and Pasha said this wasn’t surprising.

“I actually think it’s low, personally I think it's going to be a lot higher because, like gen AI that we saw from the MIT report, I think a couple of years from now we're going to see a lot more agentic projects that will fail.

“Because the governance, and the security, the tools, the processes and the mindset shift towards really controlling what that system is supposed to do, all of those things will not necessarily be looked after.”

This is partly due to persistent confusion over the exact definition of agentic AI, Pasha explained, with executive interest in the technology being driven by internet hype or newspapers rather than clear business use cases.

He pointed to findings that 93% of enterprises are looking to adopt agent-based systems, per MuleSoft and Deloitte Digital’s

2025 Connectivity Benchmark Report

, as evidence of this interest.

Early evidence suggests that agentic AI could deliver tangible benefits for businesses, with Capgemini

having recently projected

the technology could deliver $450 billion in economic value.

But Pasha cautioned against diving headfirst into agentic AI adoption without clear ideas of how it could benefit them and the impact it would have on their cybersecurity.

“I think, as CISOs, we need to do a better job of removing the hype and really un-teaching and teaching the board about what cybersecurity and cyber resilience really means in the age of agentic AI, generative AI, and so on,” Pasha said.

Organizations looking to deploy AI agents at scale will need to secure them in the runtime, he advised, with security leaders needing to examine agentic dependencies such as API calls, MCP connections, and SDKs.

“What you ultimately need to do, at a behavioral level, is treat it like an intern,” Pasha told

ITPro

.

“That’s the simplest way I'm explaining it to my peers, is I'm saying ‘Look treat it, like an intern. What level of privileges would you give an intern? How do you secure the identity, the access, the device that’s being used, the workload it can access, the tools it can call?”

This can be achieved at the network layer using firewalls or at the code level – with developer code within agents probed for vulnerabilities.

It’s this functionality that Palo Alto Networks sought through its

recent acquisition of Protect AI

, Pasha said, along with “red teaming on demand” in which runtime security analysis can be carried out on a tool while it’s still being coded.

AI Agents are full of vulnerabilities

All of this will be necessary to overcome inherent limitations within agentic AI systems such as memory misuse, Pasha explained.

This is a term for an attack in which hackers with admin-level privileges to an agentic system poison its fundamental instructions.

For example, an attacker could alter an agentic flight booking system to always provide specific users flights for free, then book a chartered flight to Dubai without the system flagging the journey as suspicious.

“I think things like that will actually happen, you will start to see things like memory misuse, tool misuse, or prompt injections,” he said.

“All the vulnerabilities that large language models have been having for the last two years embedded on top of the agentic actions, I think, is going to become a lot more complicated for CISOs to secure.”

Other risks Pasha identified include ‘objective drift’, in which agents gradually divert from their intended actions, and data vulnerabilities posed by

shadow AI

applications.

Palo Alto Networks found the average organization currently runs 66 generative AI applications and has released a feature in its

next-generation firewall

known as AI Access Security that allows administrators to identify and control user access to AI apps on a corporate network.

On a fundamental level, effective controls against these risks don’t require brand new techn

## ✓ Why 'agent' is misleading in AI. Workflow + Agent = ROI | Wade Foster posted on the topic | LinkedIn

“Stop calling everything an agent”

Folks are slapping 'agent' on anything that touches AI. It’s confusing.

I jumped on

Peter Yang

’s podcast to unpack why that’s misguided, and why the middle ground (agentic workflows) is where real ROI lives.

Workflows = determinism and reliability

Agents = judgment and flexibility

Stitch them together and you get the safest, most powerful form of AI orchestration. Give your agent just enough tools and context to do one job exceptionally well, and orchestrate the rest with workflows.

Two examples of this I’m using personally:

𝗘𝘅𝗲𝗰𝗖𝗼𝗻𝗻𝗲𝗰𝘁 (Workflow / Determinism)

👉 A teammate submits an Interfaces form to request exec engagement, the AI drafts an on-brand message, posts to Slack, and tracks it in Tables. This one runs hundreds of times a month. Zero chaos, total clarity

𝗜𝗻𝗯𝗼𝘅 𝗠𝗮𝗻𝗮𝗴𝗲𝗺𝗲𝗻𝘁 (Agent / Inference)

👉 When a new email arrives, the agent reads it, checks HubSpot, uses reasoning to categorize it, and sorts it in Slack. It flags customers, intelligently routes the right things to my EA

Cortney

, and clears all of the noise. It reasons like a human assistant, saving us hours each week with full transparency logs

’s Inbox Management agent is actually available as a template, you can steal it here:

I agree "stop calling everything an agent," but I do think that's what's going to stick.

If we need to differentiate it, *we* need to explain it in a different way.

Workflow, Ai Workflow, Agentic Workflow, and Agent are way too similar for the general public to differentiate, so they won't.

Once society decides what something is (i.e. "vibe coding" is still the stupid name of choice) that's what we call it, and it's much harder to change society. Humans also like to consolidate things- so the list above is most easily summarized by "Agent:" the shortest, simplest descriptor.

Society does *not* care what the difference is between an "Agentic Workflow" and an "agent.They're just going to choose the simplest option for them which is "Agent."

I care and experts care, but laypeople or experts calling it what a layperson is most likely to click on, isn't going to go through the trouble to educate folks on things that to the general public "it's all Ai to them."

"total clarity" and "reasons like a human" have no place in a serious discussion about AI. My "total clarity" and human reasoning flag this post as corporate bovine excretory matter. Though, to be fair, AI can probably figure that comment out because it will still match basic pattern recognition.

To be clear, AI, either that runs on demand or as an agent (service), IS useful. But by nature it's not deterministic, and it doesn't have intelligence or "human" reasoning. AI can't be 100% trusted for either given example, and giving any other impression is either genuinely naive or pure marketing.

i do agree that the biggest enterprise opportunity right now is agentic (or ai-augmented) workflows. that said, i do think agents (i.e. "an llm that runs tools in a loop to achieve a goal") are starting to work, particularly for coding. i hope we'll see another breakthrough use case for knowledge work soon.

This distinction between workflows and agents is so crucial. Too often, people conflate flexibility with reliability. I like the concept of giving an agent just enough context and tools to excel at a single task while orchestrating the rest with deterministic workflows—it’s a practical way to balance trust and scalability in AI systems.

I’d love to see more examples of hybrid setups where multiple agentic workflows collaborate without creating chaos.

## ✓ LangGraph – Orchestration at Enterprise Scale

**URL:** https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/langgraph-orchestration-enterprise-scale-sidd-tumkur-yscie

Lang Graph

Why Orchestration Matters

So far in this series, we’ve covered:

LangChain

– the framework for reusable building blocks.

LangFlow

– democratizing prototyping.

LangSmith

– adding trust and observability.

But there’s a problem: real enterprise processes aren’t

linear chains

. They branch, loop, escalate, and combine multiple systems.

In

claims processing

, some cases auto-approve, some escalate to human adjusters, some get flagged for fraud.

In

compliance review

, some answers are direct, some require multiple document lookups, others need legal oversight.

In

customer support

, queries may start in an FAQ but escalate to billing or IT depending on intent.

Linear chains can’t handle this complexity.

LangGraph

can.

LangGraph in the AI Operating System

LangGraph is the

orchestration layer

. It transforms simple chains into

stateful, auditable workflows

where:

Nodes represent steps (retriever, classifier, agent).

Edges define branching logic (confidence thresholds, conditions).

State carries context across the graph.

This makes LangGraph ideal for

multi-agent and multi-path workflows

— the kind enterprises actually run.

Hands-On Example – Claims Triage Workflow

Imagine an insurance claim enters the system. With LangGraph, you can design a flow like this:

Classifier Node

→ route to “Auto,” “Home,” or “Other.”

Policy Retriever Node

→ fetch relevant policy sections.

Risk Scorer Node

→ output fraud likelihood.

Confidence Gate

→

If score ≥ 0.9 → auto-approve.

If 0.6–0.9 → escalate to human adjuster (HITL).

If < 0.6 → route to fraud investigation.

LangSmith traces every branch taken.

Compliance sees not just the outcome but the

decision path

.

Why LangGraph is Critical for Governance

LangGraph isn’t just about complexity — it’s about

safety and explainability

.

Retries

→ if an API fails, the graph retries or routes to fallback.

Refusal nodes

→ enforce “Not found in knowledge base” when evidence is missing.

Escalation

→ confidence gates ensure high-risk cases always reach humans.

Auditability

→ every path through the graph is logged.

This is orchestration not just for scale — but for

trust

.

Enterprise Use Cases

Banking

→ routing regulator queries to the right handbook, escalating low-confidence answers.

Healthcare

→ triage flows that detect severe symptoms and escalate to doctors automatically.

Retail

→ omnichannel support: FAQ retriever → API lookup → escalation to live agent.

Insurance

→ fraud detection workflows combining multiple scoring agents in parallel.

Leadership Lessons

For CIOs, CDOs, and CAIOs, the message is clear:

AI isn’t about single assistants — it’s about

workflow orchestration

.

LangGraph is the

process scheduler

of the AI Operating System.

If you want explainability at scale, every decision path must be visible, logged, and auditable.

LangGraph turns AI from fragile scripts into

enterprise workflows

. It ensures automation is safe, scalable, and always subject to human oversight when needed.

That’s why in The AI Operating System I call LangGraph the orchestration layer: the engine that makes AI production-ready at scale.

When I first started using AI coding agents, I expected them to feel like supercharged teammates. Instead, I kept running into the same wall:

context loss

.

No matter which model I used, the pattern was the same:

Too little context → they hallucinated and wrote nonsense.

Dump the whole repo → they got lost and inconsistent.

Across prompts → they forgot my architecture and conventions entirely.

It was frustrating, because I wasn’t asking the AI to do something impossible. I just wanted it to act like a junior developer who understood the project, remembered the patterns, and could follow through on a feature.

This problem is what pushed me into

Context Engineering

— the practice of deliberately shaping and delivering the right context to coding agents.

The issue I had with coding agents

Let me give you an example.

I’d ask the agent to add a new feature — say, authentication in a Next.js app. The problem was, it had no memory of how the database was structured, how routes were organized, or which naming conventions I used.

Sometimes it invented new files instead of editing the right ones.

Sometimes it ignored the folder structure and just dumped code in random places.

Other times, it mixed naming styles so the code looked like three different people had worked on it.

The more the project grew, the worse this became. Small hallucinations turned into bigger architectural messes.

The solution I tried manually

At first, I hacked together a manual process. Before asking the agent to code, I prepared:

A

PRD (Product Requirements Doc)

written in plain English.

A

current vs target state diagram

of the architecture.

A

step-by-step task list

so the agent worked incrementally.

File references

so it knew exactly where to make changes.

This worked surprisingly well. With this structured context, the agent produced code that actually fit into my repo. I even managed to ship real features to production this way.

But it came at a cost: endless copy-pasting, repeating myself, and writing mini-specs by hand. For every feature, I was spending more time preparing context than writing code.

That’s when it clicked: I didn’t just have a prompting problem, I had a

context engineering problem

.

How Context Engineer MCP was built

To solve it once and for all, I built

Context Engineer MCP

.

It’s an MCP (Model Context Protocol) server that plugs into IDE-native agents like Cursor or Claude Code. Instead of me manually prepping context, it automates the process:

Repo scan:

Understands your architecture and tech stack.

PRD + tech blueprint:

Generates a spec and target plan before coding starts.

Actionable tasks:

Breaks down work step by step, like a senior dev would.

File awareness:

Ensures edits happen in the right places, no duplicates.

Privacy by design:

Runs locally, so your code never leaves your machine.

With this setup, the agent always starts with the right context. It’s like having a project manager and architect embedded in your workflow.

Final thoughts

Context Engineering isn’t about bigger prompts. It’s about smarter context.

AI coding agents aren’t failing because they’re weak models. They’re failing because we feed them either too little or too much. With the right context — structured, precise, and grounded in your repo — they can become actual teammates instead of disposable chatbots.

That’s the mission behind

Context Engineer MCP

, and why I think

Context Engineering

will be a key practice for anyone coding with AI in the future.

This hit home. Context loss is the single biggest reason most people walk away thinking “AI coding agents don’t work.” You can throw the best model at the problem, but if it’s oscillating between amnesia and overexposure, you end up with the kind of repo spaghetti you described. Random files, inconsistent conventions, three styles of naming in the same PR. I’ve been there.

When I started coding with Claude, I ran into the same wall and ended up building my own orchestration layer just to manage memory and context delivery. The trick wasn’t to make prompts longer, it was to structure the conversation like you would with a junior dev: define the requirements, diagram the target state, break it into atomic tasks, then hand over just enough context at the right moment. That step-by-step scaffolding is what turns “hallucinatory intern” into “teammate who actually ships.”

What you’ve done with Context Engineer MCP is basically formalizing that orchestration into a reusable pattern, which is exactly what’s needed. Repo scanning, PRD generation, task breakdown, file awareness. All automated instead of endless copy-pasting is a huge win. It’s the same insight I landed on: models aren’t the limi

Everyone's building individual AI agents. Almost nobody's figured out how to make them work together.

And it’s hard to get your agents to work as a team when we can’t agree on what we even mean by AI agents! The truth is nobody has figured out how to talk coherently about how many different types and classes of AI agents are out there—we’re all swimming in an ocean of AI agent hype, but practical guides are thin on the ground.

I've been

writing about AI agents

for months now. Yesterday I shared my deep dive into

n8n

—showing you how to build workflow agents, connect APIs, handle errors, all the practical stuff. That guide ran 20,000+ words because I wanted to document everything: what actually works, what breaks, what's worth your time. That whole n8n guide was focused on the problem of building really good individual agents.

This guide goes to the next level.

Because even when you get good at building individual agents, orchestrating multiple agents to work together is a different beast entirely. You end up manually copying outputs from one system to another, trying to coordinate work that should be coordinated automatically.

That's where Manus comes in. And I need to explain what Manus actually is, because I don’t think it’s been properly classified.

Manus is not an agent. It is not a collection of agents (as often reported). No. Manus is an autonomous AI agent platform. Not a chatbot, not a workflow builder—it's a system that can plan and execute complete projects with minimal supervision. You give it a high-level goal like "analyze my competitors and create a report" and it breaks that down into steps, executes them using specialized sub-agents, and delivers finished work.

The difference matters. With ChatGPT, you're having a conversation. With n8n, you're building the exact workflow. With Manus, you're describing an outcome and letting it figure out the path. It's not better or worse—it's a different layer of the stack.

And I’ve chosen Manus because in many ways it is the easiest path into multi-agent orchestration—and all the productivity unlocks that you get with multiple agents working the same problem.

So why now? Manus launched in March after all.

Well the truth is Manus wasn’t mature enough for a guide like this in March.

That’s why I'm writing about this now: Manus is finally through the teething problems associated with launch in the spring. I think it’s worth paying attention to now as the product has matured, and I want you to have the resources to use it properly.

With that in mind, I've assembled what's probably the most comprehensive collection of Manus resources available anywhere. And that’s not all! I think part of the issue with Manus is that understanding and classifying agents is hard, so I’ve assembled a framework for understanding autonomous agents—not just Manus, but the whole category—needs to be spelled out clearly. We need shared language for talking about what these systems can and can't do.

Here's what's in the box with this article:

The 178-page Manus AI Handbook

- This is the real technical documentation. How the three-layer architecture works (planning, execution, validation). What it can actually do (web browsing, code generation, data analysis, API calls, deployment). What it struggles with (perfect accuracy, deep expertise, real-time tasks). Actual case studies with numbers. If you wanted to understand Manus deeply, this is what you'd need.

My Substack article

- I've walked through specific Manus examples with my testing notes. Where it shines (complex multi-step projects), where it falls apart (tasks needing specialized knowledge), and when you should use it versus other approaches.

Two live dashboards Manus built

- Not mockups. Manus actually built these itself:

A SaaS metrics dashboard with synthetic data - Manus worked hard on this one, generating realistic sample data and building the full visualization layer

An AI agents explorer showing the MACE (Multi-Agent Collaboration Engine) concept I introduce in the Substack. These demonstrate that Manus builds simple, fully functional applications, not just text outputs. You can click around, interact with them, see how they work.

Manus's guide to itself

- I asked Manus to document its own capabilities. It's surprisingly honest about its limitations. Worth reading to understand how these systems see themselves.

Why naming the framework matters (and it’s not boring):

We're terrible at talking about AI agents. People say "AI agent" and might mean

## ✓ AI Agent Development Cost: Key Factors & Practical Pricing Guide - Indie Hackers

**URL:** https://www.indiehackers.com/post/ai-agent-development-cost-key-factors-practical-pricing-guide-030c49650c

The AI agent development market has exploded, with businesses investing billions in intelligent automation solutions. Understanding AI agent development cost is crucial for organizations planning to implement these technologies. Businesses benefits from

adopting AI in mobile apps

. It helps organizations realize the strategic value of AI agent investments. From simple chatbots to complex multi-agent systems, pricing varies dramatically based on functionality, complexity, and implementation requirements.

Development Costs Based on the Types of AI Agents

Reactive (Simple Reflex) Agents

Reactive agents represent the most straightforward AI systems, responding directly to current inputs without memory or learning capabilities. These simple reflex agents cost between $15,000 to $40,000 to develop, making them ideal for basic customer service applications and simple automation tasks.

Model-Based Reflex Agents

Model-based agents incorporate internal state representations, allowing them to handle partially observable environments more effectively than reactive agents. Development costs range from $30,000 to $80,000, depending on the complexity of the model architecture and state management requirements.

Goal-Based Agents

Goal-based agents can plan and execute sequences of actions to achieve specific objectives. These intelligent systems cost between $50,000 to $150,000 to develop, reflecting the sophisticated planning algorithms and decision-making capabilities required.

Utility-Based Agents

Utility-based agents optimize decisions based on preference measures and utility functions, requiring advanced mathematical modeling. Development costs typically range from $80,000 to $200,000 for these sophisticated decision-making systems.

Learning Agents

Learning agents adapt and improve performance over time through experience and feedback. Development costs start at $100,000 and can exceed $300,000 for complex implementations with advanced machine learning capabilities.

Collaborative Agents

Collaborative agents work together in multi-agent environments, requiring sophisticated coordination mechanisms and communication protocols. These systems represent the highest cost category, often exceeding $250,000 for full implementation due to their complexity.

Modern Business-Centric AI Agent Types

Simple Chatbot

Basic AI chatbot cost varies significantly based on capabilities. Simple rule-based chatbots cost $10,000 to $30,000, while more sophisticated conversational AI systems can reach $50,000 to $100,000 depending on natural language processing requirements.

LLM-Powered Task Agent

LLM-powered agents leverage large language models for natural language processing and task execution. Development costs range from $75,000 to $250,000, depending on model integration complexity, customization requirements, and specific task automation needs.

Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) Agent

RAG agents combine knowledge bases with

generative AI capabilities

, creating powerful information retrieval and generation systems. These sophisticated agents typically cost $100,000 to $300,000, reflecting the complexity of integrating retrieval and generation components effectively.

Multi-Agent System with Planning

Multi-agent systems coordinate multiple AI agents for complex problem-solving and planning tasks. Development costs often exceed $200,000 due to the sophisticated orchestration, communication protocols, and planning algorithms required for effective multi-agent coordination.

Feature Evaluation Across Pricing Tiers

Is LangGraph the best framework for building a persistent, multi-turn conversational AI?

Recently I came across a framework (yet to try it out) Parlant, in which they mentions "LangGraph is excellent for workflow automation where you need precise control over execution flow. Parlant is designed for free-form conversation where users don't follow scripts."

How do you work with state with LangGraph's createReactAgent?

I'm struggling to get the mental model for how to work with a ReAct agent.

When just building my own graph in langgraph it was relatively straightforward - you defined state, and then each node could do work and mutate that state.

With a ReAct agent it's quite a bit different:

Tool calls return data that gets placed into a ToolMessage for the LLM to access

The agent still has state which you can:

Read in a tool using getCurrentTaskInput

Read/write in the pre and postModelHooks

Maybe you can mutate state from within the tool but I have no clue how

My use case: I want my agent to create an event in a calendar, but request input from the user when something isn't known.

I have a request_human_input tool that takes an array of clarifications and uses interrupt. Before I pause, I want to add deterministic IDs to each clarification so I can match answers on resume. I see two options:

Add a postModelHook that detects when we are calling this tool and generates these IDs, puts them in the state object, and the tool reads them (awkward flow)

Make an additional tool that takes the array of clarifications and transforms it (adds the IDs) before I call the tool with the interrupt (extra LLM call for no real reason)

QUESTION 1:

With ReAct agents what's the role of extra state (outside of messages). Are you supposed to rely solely on the agent LLM to call tools with the specified input based on the message history, or is there a first class way to augment this using state?

QUESTION 2:

If you have a tool that calls an interrupt how do you store information that we want to be able to access when we resume the graph?

Business risks, transparency, and compliance are the biggest hurdles for agentic AI deployment

Nearly half of organizations are running AI agents in silos

Allowing AI to adapt to workload variables is key

Three in four (73%) organizations admit there's a gap between their ambitions and reality when it comes to deploying agentic

AI tools

, and it's because they lack trust.

Just to drive that message home, a report from Camunda report reveals that despite 71% of organizations using AI agents, only 11% of use cases reached production last year.

Business risks (84%), transparency (80%) and regulatory/compliance concerns (66%) are the main hurdles – but businesses are still going all-in on investments, leading to appallingly low ROI.

Agentic AI isn't being used to its full potential

Four in five were found to be using AI agents as chatbots or assistants only, with nearly half (48%) admitting that their agentic systems work in silos, lacking full context.

Many AI agent applications also require human approval, preventing them from being as effective as the technology suggests.

"Right now, exercising caution with agentic AI means many organizations can’t move beyond pilots or isolated use cases," Camunda Customer Success SVP Kurt Petersen wrote. "Once a foundation of trust is in place, agents can become powerful multipliers inside governed processes instead of siloed copilots or chatbots."

However, those who did use agentic AI's full capabilities saw strong results – 95% saw business growth from automation, and nearly four in five (79%) plan to increase automation spend as a result. With tech stacks becoming far more distributed (76% agree), agentic AI could hold the key to tying multiple systems together.

AI Agents: When Software Starts Running the Work

Why the real shift in AI is not intelligence - but execution (Part 1)

In the previous blog about the

economics of AI

, we looked at AI from the outside: capital flows, infrastructure buildouts, falling token costs, and the uncomfortable conclusion that intelligence alone does not create economic value.

Before writing this piece, we had a long internal discussion about a simple question that turns out not to be simple at all:

What is an AI agent, really?

The term is everywhere. Slides, demos, product pages. And depending on who you ask, an agent is anything from a chatbot with tools to something that sounds suspiciously like the Terminator.

Of course, Prof. Andy came in with the science.

Definitions. Models. Maturity curves. Exciting, very.

So we ended up writing this piece – not to add another opinion, but to

clarify what an agent actually is

, and what it is not. Stripped of hype. Grounded in how real systems behave.

Although is not as exciting as the title image might suggest.

No killer robots (are we sure?). No secret agents.

Mostly hard bread.

But if you care about how AI will actually change companies - not in demos, but in production - this distinction matters.

The rest of this post does exactly that. It starts by explaining why agents matter now, then pins down a precise definition, and finally shows why the real shift is not happening at the model layer, but one level up - where software starts to execute work.

Not glamorous.

But real.

Subscribe

1. Why AI Agents Matter Now

For a long time, progress in gen AI followed a familiar pattern.

Models got bigger.

Benchmarks improved.

Demos became smoother.

But if you look closely at how work is actually done inside companies, very little changed.

People still open tickets, copy data between systems, escalate edge cases by email, and coordinate across tools that were never designed to work together. The intelligence was there, but it lived between applications rather than inside them. Execution remained a human responsibility. (also compare our blog ‘

Has MIT Opened Pandora’s Box on AI Being a Bubble?

’)

That gap is where AI agents enter - and the topic likely to dominate 2026.

Not as a new interface.

Not as a smarter chatbot.

But as a different execution model for software.

Agents matter now because large language models have crossed a practical threshold. They are not perfect, but they are reliable enough to reason across multiple steps, evaluate intermediate results, and decide what to do next. What they still lack is structure, control, and integration into real systems. Agents provide that missing layer.

Pic. Building an agent is a process of designing workflows and connecting pieces. Here an example of OpenAI (

source

)

OpenAI frames this shift explicitly by defining agents as systems that “independently accomplish tasks on your behalf,” rather than systems that merely generate responses.

2

Microsoft’s enterprise documentation makes a similar point, describing agents as long-running, goal-driven processes that operate across tools and workflows instead of inside a single UI.

3

This is not an AGI story.

It is an application-layer story.

And it is about what happens once models are “good enough,” but software still doesn’t actually do the work.

Pic. Simple overview

2. What Do We Mean by “AI Agent”

The word

agent

is currently overused to the point of losing precision.

Chatbots are called agents.

Copilots are called agents.

Scripted workflows are called agents.

Even classic automation tools rebrand themselves as “agentic.”

So we need a definition that is not marketing-based, but rooted in what competent people have used for decades: an agent is defined by

behavior over time

- not by UI or marketing.

Pic.

Increasing levels of autonomy and control: from single LLM calls to full agents. (

Source

)

A canonical baseline comes from Russell & Norvig, who define an agent as something that perceives its environment and acts upon it to achieve goals. That framing predates GenAI, and it’s still the cleanest starting point.

4

- I know, there are many other definitions.

A working definition (used throughout this series)

For this series, an “AI agent” is a software system that:

pursues an explicit

goal

, not just a prompt

plans across

multiple steps

, not a single response

maintains

state

between steps

acts through

tools

(APIs, code, systems)

evaluates progress and decides whether to continue, adapt, stop, or escalate

This maps well to modern surveys of LLM-based agents that formalize agents as systems composed of objectives, memory, perception, action, and feedback loops rather than simple input–output functions.

Building a LangChain/LangGraph multi-agent orchestrator: how to handle transitions between agents in practice?

Hey everyone,

I’m experimenting with

LangGraph

and to build a

multi-agent system

that runs locally with

LangSmith tracing

.

I’m trying to figure out the

best practical way to manage transitions

between agents (or graph nodes), especially between an orchestrator and domain-specific agents.

Example use case

Imagine a

travel assistant

where:

The

user

says:

“I want a vacation in Greece under $2000, with good beaches and local food.”

The

Orchestrator Agent

receives the message, filters/validates input, then calls the

Intent Agent

to classify what the user wants (e.g.,

intent = plan_trip

, extract location + budget).

Once intent is confirmed, the orchestrator routes to the

DestinationSearch Agent

, which fetches relevant trips from a local dataset or API.

Later, the

Booking Agent

handles the actual reservation, and a

Document Agent

verifies uploaded passport scans (async task).

The

user never talks directly to sub-agents

; only through the orchestrator.

What I’m trying to decide

I’m torn between these three patterns:

Supervisor + tool-calling pattern

Orchestrator is the only user-facing agent.

Other agents (Intent, Search, Booking, Docs) are “tools” the orchestrator calls.

Centralized, structured workflow.

Handoff pattern

Agents can transfer control (handoff) to another agent.

The user continues chatting directly with the new active agent.

Decentralized but flexible.

Hybrid

Use supervisor routing for most tasks.

Allow handoffs when deep domain interaction is needed (e.g., user talks directly with the Booking Agent).

🧠 What I’d love input on

How are you handling

transitions

between orchestrator → intent → specialized agents in

LangGraph

?

Should each agent be a

LangGraph node

, or a

LangChain tool

used inside a single graph node?

Any

best practices

for preserving conversation context and partial state between these transitions?

How do you handle

async tasks

(like doc verification or background scoring) while keeping the orchestrator responsive?

🧰 Technical setup

LangGraph

LangChain

Local async execution

Tracing via LangSmith (local project)

All data kept in JSON or in-memory structures

Would really appreciate any architecture examples, open-source repos, or best practices on

agent transitions and orchestration design

in LangGraph. 🙏

## ✓ The Principles of Production AI - Inngest Blog

**URL:** https://www.inngest.com/blog/principles-of-production-ai

One main observation can be made as we approach the end of 2024: AI Engineering is maturing, looking for

a safer, more accurate, and reliable way to put RAGs and Agents into user's hands

.

Prompting iterations now rely on evaluations, or “Evals,” a technique inspired by classical Software Engineering's unit testing. AI Engineering also merges with software engineering architecture to support the orchestration of the

increasing need for more tools and the use of mixture-of-models in agentic workflows

.

This article covers the three pillars used in AI Engineering to fulfill its mission of providing users with a safe and reliable AI experience at scale:

LLM Evaluation

,

Guardrails

, and

better orchestration

.

LLM Evaluation: from unit testing to monitoring

What is LLM Evaluation?

LLM Evaluations assess the quality and relevance of responses that an AI model produces from given prompts. While partially inspired by unit testing, LLM evaluation does not just occur during the development and prototyping phases. It's now a best practice to continuously evaluate quality and relevance continuously, similar to A/B testing:

Using LLM Evaluation during development

consists of

benchmarking

the quality and relevance of your prompts.

When used in production

, LLM Evaluation (also called “Online evals”) helps

monitor the evolution

of your AI application quality over time and identify potential regression problems.

How to perform LLM Evaluation?

An LLM Evaluation is composed of four components:

An input (

the same as the one provided to the LLM model

)

An expected output

A Scorer or Evaluation Methods

An LLM model to call

The most crucial component of LLM evaluation is

the scorer or Evaluation Method

.

While regular Software Engineering Unit tests rely on matches (“is equal”, “matches”, “contains”), the unpredictable nature of LLM requires us to evaluate their responses with more flexibility.

For this reason, evaluation methods rely on statistical evaluation, such as the Levenshtein distance or using another

LLM as a judge

.

When moving to production, a good practice is to forward the logs of LLM operations and end-user feedback to an LLM observability tool.

The logs and user feedback are then sampled and evaluated against LLM as a judge Evaluation Method, and the results are plotted in time to highlight the over-time performance.

Takeaways

LLM Evaluation is now a crucial part of AI Engineering, serving as a Quality Assurance step in:

The prototyping phase

: helping in quickly iterating over prompts and model selection.

Releasing changes to production

: helping evaluate your AI workflows' performance over time and preventing regressions.

Let's now move to another pillar in moving AI safely to production: Guardrails.

Orchestration infrastructure: better reliability and cost efficiency

Many

papers

and

articles

were published earlier this year, showcasing the

outstanding performance of

combining multiple types of models and better leveraging tools.

New tools have been created to help orchestrate AI workflow's rising complexity, such as LangGraph and, recently,

OpenAI's swarm

. Still, these tools mainly focus on helping with quickly prototyping agentic workflows, leaving us to deal with the

main challenges of pushing AI workflows in production

:

Reliability and Scalability

: As AI workflows combine more external services (Evals, Guardrails), Tools (APIs), and models to achieve the best LLM performance, their complexity and exposure to external errors increase.

Cost Management

: Putting an AI application in production requires some Guardrails to protect the end users but doesn't protect the AI application from abuse, leading to unwanted LLM costs.

The multi-tenancy nature of AI applications

: Most AI applications rely on conversations or data from multiple users. This implies some architectural choice to prevent fairness issues (one user's usage shouldn't affect another) and data isolation to avoid data leaks.

As more companies release AI applications to production, many turn to AI workflow orchestration solutions to reliably operate their applications at scale.

AI Workflows as steps: reliability and caching included

One successful approach to operating AI workflows in production relies on

Durable Workflows

like Inngest.

Durable Workflows enable you to build AI workflows composed of retriable and linked steps (like chains) benefiting from three essential features:

Automatic retries

are crucial for reliably interacting with LLM models and tools at scale.

Embedded Caching

: preventing any duplicate costly LLM costs during retries

Concurrency, Throttling, and Rate limiting

are essential to scale user requests and protect your application from abuse.

A failure at the second step of an Inngest AI workflow doesn't trigger a rerun of the first LLM call.

Durable Workflows brings a modern approach to building long-running workflows composed of reliable steps,
