OpenAI’s GPT-5 escalates Anthropic enterprise rivalry

TechCheck

Sam Altman

turned

OpenAI

into a cultural phenomenon with

ChatGPT

.

Now, three years later, he's chasing where the real money is: Enterprise.

Last week's rollout of

GPT-5

, OpenAI's newest

artificial intelligence

model, was rocky. Critics bashed its less-intuitive feel, ultimately leading the company to restore its legacy GPT-4 to paying

chatbot

customers.

But GPT-5 isn't about the consumer. It's OpenAI's effort to crack the enterprise market, where rival

Anthropic

has enjoyed a head start.

One week in, and startups like

Cursor

, Vercel, and Factory say they've already made GPT-5 the default model in certain key products and tools, touting its faster setup, better results on complex tasks, and a lower price.

Some companies said GPT-5 now matches or beats

Claude

on code and interface design, a space Anthropic once dominated.

Box

, another enterprise customer, has been testing GPT-5 on long, logic-heavy documents. CEO Aaron Levie told CNBC the model is a "breakthrough," saying it performs with a level of reasoning that prior systems couldn't match.

Behind the scenes, OpenAI has built out its own enterprise sales team — more than 500 people under COO Brad Lightcap — operating independently of

Microsoft

, which has been the startup's lead investor and key cloud partner. Customers can access GPT models through Microsoft Azure or go directly to OpenAI, which controls the API and product experience.

Still, the economics are brutal. The models are expensive to run, and both OpenAI and Anthropic are spending big to lock in customers, with OpenAI on track to burn $8 billion this year.

That's part of why both Anthropic and OpenAI are courting new capital.

OpenAI is exploring a secondary stock sale that could value the company around

$500 billion

and said ChatGPT is

nearing 700 million weekly users

.

Anthropic is seeking fresh funding at a potential

$170 billion valuation

.

Winning over enterprise

GPT-5 is significantly cheaper than Anthropic's top-end Claude Opus 4.1 — by a factor of seven and a half, in some cases — but OpenAI is spending huge amounts on infrastructure to sustain that edge.

For OpenAI, it's a push to win customers now, get them locked in and build a real business on the back of that loyalty.

Cursor, still a major Anthropic customer, is now steering new users to OpenAI. The company's co-founder and CEO Michael Truell underscored the change during

OpenAI's launch livestream

, describing GPT-5 as "the smartest coding model we've ever tried."

TechCheck

Truell said the change applies only to new sign-ups, as existing Cursor customers will continue using Anthropic as their default model. Cursor maintains a committed-revenue contract with Anthropic, which has built its business on dominating the enterprise layer.

As of June, enterprise makes up about 80% of its revenue, with annualized revenue growing 17x year-over-year, said a person familiar with the matter who requested anonymity in order to discuss company data. The company added $3 billion in revenue in just the past six months — including $1 billion in June alone — and has already signed triple the number of eight- and nine-figure deals this year compared to all of 2024, the person said.

Anthropic said its enterprise footprint extends far beyond tech.

Claude powers tools for

Amazon

Prime, Alexa, and

AIG

, and is used by top players in pharma, retail, aviation, and professional services. The company is embedded across Amazon Web Services, GCP,

Snowflake

, Databricks, and

Palantir

— and its deals tend to expand fast.

Average customer spend has grown more than fivefold over the past year, with over half of business clients now using multiple Claude products, the person said.

Excluding its two largest customers, revenue for the rest of the business has grown more than elevenfold year-over-year, the person said.

Even with that broad reach, OpenAI is gaining ground with enterprise c

## ✓ OpenAI GPT-5: Revolutionary unified AI system reshapes enterprise cloud architecture - European AI & Cloud Summit

**URL:** https://cloudsummit.eu/blog/openai-gpt-5-revolutionary-unified-ai-system

OpenAI GPT-5: Revolutionary unified AI system reshapes enterprise cloud architecture

OpenAIâs GPT-5, released August 7, 2025, fundamentally transforms enterprise AI deployment through its unified intelligent routing system that automatically switches between four specialized variants, delivering

80% fewer hallucinations

than previous models while cutting costs by 50% compared to GPT-4. The system achieves breakthrough performance with 74.9% on SWE-bench coding tasks and 94.6% on advanced mathematics benchmarks, positioning it as the most capable and cost-effective enterprise AI solution available. For European organizations, GPT-5âs Azure EU Data Boundary compliance and upcoming Norwegian Stargate facility address critical sovereignty requirements while enabling transformative business applications across industries.

Unified architecture revolutionizes model deployment strategy

GPT-5 introduces a paradigm shift in AI architecture through its unified system approach, eliminating the complexity of manual model selection that plagued previous generations. The system comprises

five core components

: gpt-5-main for fast responses, gpt-5-thinking for complex reasoning, lightweight mini variants for cost optimization, and an intelligent real-time router that automatically selects the optimal model based on query complexity and user intent. This architecture processes up to

400,000 tokens

(272K input, 128K output), enabling analysis of entire codebases or extensive documentation in single requests.

The intelligent routing system learns continuously from production signals including user model switching patterns, response preference rates, and measured correctness metrics. When users type queries requiring deep analysis, the router automatically engages thinking mode, which can spend additional compute time reasoning through problems before responding. For routine queries, it defaults to the faster main model, optimizing both cost and performance. This automatic optimization means enterprises no longer need dedicated ML engineers to manage model selection, reducing operational overhead by an estimated

50% in engineering hours

.

The unified approach extends to pricing strategy, with the standard GPT-5 model costing

$1.25 per million input tokens and $10 per million output tokens

- a 50% reduction in input costs compared to GPT-4o. Mini and nano variants offer even more aggressive pricing at $0.25/$2 and $0.05/$0.40 respectively, enabling cost-effective deployment for high-volume applications. The system includes a sophisticated caching mechanism providing

90% discounts

on repeated input tokens within minutes, particularly beneficial for conversational applications and iterative development workflows.

Performance metrics demonstrate enterprise-grade reliability

GPT-5âs performance improvements over previous models establish new benchmarks for enterprise AI reliability. The most significant advancement comes in hallucination reduction, with the system demonstrating

45% fewer factual errors than GPT-4o

in standard mode and

80% fewer errors than OpenAIâs o3 model

when thinking mode is engaged. On healthcare benchmarks, GPT-5 achieves a remarkable

1.6% hallucination rate on HealthBench Hard

, compared to 12.9% for GPT-4o and 15.8% for o3, making it suitable for safety-critical applications previously considered too risky for AI deployment.

Coding capabilities represent another breakthrough area, with GPT-5 achieving

74.9% accuracy on SWE-bench Verified

, establishing a new state-of-the-art benchmark that surpasses both OpenAIâs o3 (69.1%) and GPT-4 (54.6%). The Aider Polyglot benchmark shows even more impressive results at

88% accuracy

across multiple programming languages including C++, Go, Java, JavaScript, Python, and Rust. When reasoning mode is enabled, the system demonstrates a 61.3-point improvement in coding accuracy, with error rates reduced by one-third compared to o3. These improvements translate directly to developer productivity, with internal testing showing GPT-5

beats o3 in 70% of frontend development tasks

.

Mathematical reasoning capabilities have reached near-human expert levels, with GPT-5 scoring

94.6% on AIME 2025

mathematics competitions and achieving 100% accuracy when thinking mode is fully engaged. On graduate-level scientific questions (GPQA Diamond), GPT-5 Pro variant achieves

89.4% accuracy

, significantly outperforming competitors. The systemâs enhanced reasoning extends to complex multi-step problems, with

42% accuracy on Humanityâs Last Exam

- a collection of expert-crafted questions designed to test the limits of AI understanding.

Business features address enterprise implementation challenges

GPT-5âs business-focused enhancements directly address the practical challenges enterprises face when deploying AI at scale. The new

Azure AI Foundry GPT5 different response than main OpenAI GPT5

I am on AI foundry and I have been getting complaints at my job that the LLM response quality was inaccurate or poor. So go to Ai Foundry playground and  I choose the model that we use which is GPT-5.

So I ask in the playground directly "What version of OpenAI are you"

Foundry said this exactly

"Im ChatGPT, an AI from OPENAI. In this interface I dont have visibility into the exact model identifier. I'm a GPT-4 class multimodal model with a knowledge cutoff of October 2024.

I ask the same to OpenAI direct on ChatGPT com  and its response was

"I'm GPT-5, the latest generation OpenAI model"

So why does one know what it is and the other is clueless? This is no good at all. Does Azure have lower quality models? Why would it say this if I chose GPT-5 in both tests?

Generative AI Trends 2025: Scaling LLMs & Enterprise AI Adoption

Enterprises are rapidly moving beyond narrow pilots. Instead, they’re strategically integrating LLMs into workflows, governance, and decision systems—pushing GenAI toward maturity.

Generative AI Trends 2025: Enterprises scale LLMs efficiently with governance and interoperability.

1.

LLMs in 2025: Scaling Up, Down, and Out

LLM proliferation isn’t just about bigger models. According to Stanford’s 2025 AI Index, training compute doubles every five months, datasets every eight, and efficiency gaps between top models are shrinking rapidly.

Scholars propose a new paradigm—AI model scaling now includes “scaling down” (lightweight models) and “scaling out” (distributed/specialized workloads) to enhance efficiency, sustainability, and enterprise access.

2.

Enterprise AI Adoption Soars in 2025

Gartner forecasts that over 80% of enterprises will deploy generative AI applications or APIs by 2026—a steep rise from only 5% in 2023.

McKinsey reports that generative AI usage across businesses jumped from 33% overall to 78%, with marketing, IT, and operations leading the way.

Real-world outcomes are evident:

JPMorgan Chase

reduced fraud using LLMs

Walmart

optimized inventory and reduced stockouts

UnitedHealth

automated claims processing

FedEx

enhanced route and delivery times

3.

AI Model Scaling & Infrastructure Evolution

Enterprise-grade AI innovation hinges on infrastructure. The latest review of cloud platforms (AWS, Azure, Google Cloud, IBM, etc.) highlights the rise of GPU clusters, edge computing, serverless architectures, and advanced storage technologies to support generative workloads.

Cerebras recently set new benchmarks in inference speed—powering Llama models 18× faster than GPU alternatives—highlighting how specialized hardware drives model scaling.

4.

Challenges: AI Sprawl and Governance Gaps

Rapid adoption comes with complexity. TechRadar warns of unchecked “AI sprawl”—multiple tools without unified governance—leading to inefficiencies, security concerns, and siloed systems.

Enterprise leaders face hurdles. As per ModelOp, only 14% of organizations enforce AI assurance. Without robust governance, scaling becomes risky.

5.

Interoperability via LLM Standardization

To curb tooling fragmentation, OpenAI and DeepMind adopted the

Model Context Protocol (MCP)

in early 2025. MCP sets a standard for multi-model interoperability—simplifying how enterprises connect LLMs to APIs, databases, and workflows.

By bridging models with tools—like Microsoft’s COPILOT and Azure system integration—MCP is enabling seamless enterprise AI orchestration.

6.

Enterprise Readiness: Governance, Training & Leadership

Analysis from McKinsey and ICONIQ underlines that deploying generative AI at scale requires robust governance, AI literacy, and leadership alignment. Stylish governance frameworks amplify performance and ROI.

CIO insights (a16z) emphasize proactive construction of AI buying/building strategies for 2025—grounded in safety, scalability, and metrics.

Experts Weigh In & Market Reality

Business Insider profiles enterprise AI leaders shaping the new era—from Mastercard’s fraud bots to IKEA’s AI education rollout—illustrating how generative AI is both utility and strategy.Meanwhile, Gartner reports AI sprawl is giving way to integrated AI architecture as core business infrastructure.

AI was implemented as a trial in my company, and it’s scary.

I know that almost everyday someone comes up and says AI will take my job and I’m scared but I promise to keep this short and maybe different.

I am currently a junior devops, so not huge experience or knowledge, but I was told that the team are trying to implement Claude code into vs code for the dev team and MCPs for provisioning and then later for monitoring generally and taking action when something fails.

The trial was that Claude code was so good in the testing, it scared me alittle, because it planned and worked with hundreds of files, found what it needs to do, and did it first try (now fully implemented)

With the MCP, it was like a junior devops/SRE, and after that trial, the company stopped the hiring cycle and the team is kept at only 4 instead of expanding to 6 as planned, and honestly from what I saw, I even think they might view it as “4 too many”.

This is all happening 3 years after ChatGPT released, 3 years and people are already getting scared shitless. I thought AI was a good boost, but I don’t think management would see it as a boost, but a junior replacement and maybe later a full replacement.

What technology leaders need to ensure AI delivers

That kind of growth is great for innovation, but it also puts new strain on the systems that keep everything running. And the biggest stress point is not compute or storage. It is the network.

Doubts about GPT-5

Some in the tech world have doubts about GPT-5, but that has not slowed big companies from rolling it out fast.

Developers

and everyday users have pointed out both real gains and stubborn limits, and that mix of praise and criticism makes it clear that if you are moving from small trials to full production, you need

IT infrastructure

that can grow and hold up under the load.

CIOs, in particular, are moving very fast to adopt GPT-5 and integrate it into the business. But many are doing it without a clear view of how these systems move data. AI like this thrives on real-time processing and seamless access to cloud models.

It streams video, audio, large language prompts, and business data back and forth constantly. That is not the kind of traffic most enterprise networks were built to handle.

Legacy Networks Weren’t Built for AI Traffic

A lot of organizations are still relying on networks that were designed years ago: MPLS circuits, centralized

business VPNs

, maybe a stitched-together SD-WAN solution. These setups were fine for email and SaaS apps. But GPT-5 is different. It generates unpredictable, high-volume traffic across cloud regions and business units.

The model might pull data from a

CRM platform

in one region, process it through a cloud-hosted inference engine somewhere else, and send results to a user interface halfway around the world.

Powering the AI data center boom: the infrastructure upgrades behind innovation

What technology leaders need to ensure AI delivers

If your network is not flexible and responsive, it is going to slow everything down. Latency kills the experience. Poor routing breaks workflows. Limited visibility turns performance issues into guessing games. And when that happens, it is the AI that gets blamed, when the real problem is the path the data had to travel.

Evolving Network Architecture for AI Workloads

The challenge is largely architectural. Traditional networks built device by device and link by link often face scalability challenges when supporting high-demand AI workloads.

Expanding to new sites or regions frequently requires significant project planning, and deploying new applications involves coordination across networking, security, and cloud teams, processes that can slow down IT responsiveness needed for rapid AI adoption.

Many organizations are exploring evolving network architectures that emphasize scalability, global reach, and on-demand provisioning to address these challenges.

Emerging models aim to support dynamic service delivery rather than fixed connections and reduce reliance on hardware-centric environments. This shift can enable IT teams to provision network resources more flexibly and quickly as business needs evolve.

Industry adoption of cloud-inspired networking designs has shown potential benefits including streamlined deployment of AI tools, improved traffic routing based on application requirements, and enhanced workload segmentation to balance performance and security.

These approaches often aim to minimize manual reconfiguration efforts and better support rapid innovation cycles. In short, they provide a more adaptive foundation for modern enterprise workloads.

Enterprise enthusiasm for generative

AI tools

is no longer speculative - it is systemic.

A

Microsoft

-IDC study shows adoption climbing from 55 percent in 2023 to 75 percent in 2024, while Gartner expects more than 80 percent of organizations to run GenAI applications in production by 2026.

Yet beneath the acceleration sits an uncomfortable reality: over half of enterprises still do not track basic data-quality metrics, and as many as 60 percent will fail to capture the full value of their AI roadmaps due to inadequate data governance.

Ambition has outrun discipline - and in the age of probabilistic systems, discipline is spelled G-O-V-E-R-N-A-N-C-E.

Arvind Rao

Chief Technology Officer, Edge Platforms, EdgeVerve.

Data governance - in the AI context - is the continuous system of policies, controls, and accountabilities that keeps data fit, permitted, traceable, and secure, while making model behavior transparent and defensible across the lifecycle.

It governs what enters the model (lineage, quality, consent), how the model behaves (bias, drift, explainability), and where and how its outputs are used (privacy, jurisdiction, policy).

When these controls are weak or bolted on late, organizations invite disinformation, bias, regulatory exposure, and

security

gaps - risks that compound as programs move from pilots to production and from assistance to autonomy.

The urgency is amplified by the rise of agentic systems that do not merely summarize but decide and act, often in real time with limited human intervention. That step change demands governance designed from day one: clear ownership, enforceable policy, observable data flows, and tested escalation paths.

Treat data governance as the

operating system

of trust and AI becomes repeatable value at scale; neglect it and speed turns into risk at scale.

Data Governance Redefined for AI

Traditional stewardship asked who owns

data

and where it lives. Generative and agentic systems widen the lens. The question is now: Can we trust what the model learns, creates and decides?

Governance therefore expands to four continuous controls: input integrity (lineage, quality, rights), model behavior (bias, drift, transparency), operational constraints (privacy, geography, ethics) and accountability (audit trails from data to decision).

Treating these controls as a post-launch checklist is a category error; they must be designed into every stage of the lifecycle.

Why Generative and Agentic AI Raise the Stakes

GenAI does not merely analyze, it synthesizes and publishes. That creativity introduces intellectual-property questions, factual hallucinations and reputational exposure.

Agentic AI goes further, adjusting limits, rerouting shipments or repricing products without human supervision. In that context, an errant training set is more than a technical glitch; it is an

enterprise

-level risk.

Five Pillars of Robust Governance

1. Quality & Reliability

– Continuous validation keeps data fit for purpose and prevents small biases from compounding at scale.

2. Security & Privacy

–

Encryption

, role-based access and region-specific residency turn privacy into a license to innovate.

3. Transparency & Explainability

– Traceability from dataset through model version to recommendation equips auditors and executives with a defensible “why”.

4. Ethics & Fairness

– Bias tests, counter-factual evaluation and human-in-the-loop review guard against discriminatory outcomes.

5. Compliance Readiness

– Automated policy enforcement and versioned documentation slash the cost and cycle-time of meeting statutes such as the EU AI Act.

From Policy to Practice

Despite the urgency, meaningful execution is still rare. A 2024 Deloitte

benchmark

on responsible-AI practices finds that fewer than one in ten organizations have a governance framework robust enough to track data lineage, bias, and model oversight across the enterprise.

The state of AI in 2025: Agents, innovation, and transformation

November 5, 2025

| Survey

Almost all survey respondents say their organizations are using AI, and many have begun to use AI agents. But most are still in the early stages of scaling AI and capturing enterprise-level value.

(30 pages)

Key findings

Most organizations are still in the experimentation or piloting phase:

Nearly two-thirds of respondents say their organizations have not yet begun scaling AI across the enterprise.

High curiosity in AI agents:

Sixty-two percent of survey respondents say their organizations are at least experimenting with AI agents.

Positive leading indicators on impact of AI:

Respondents report use-case-level cost and revenue benefits, and 64 percent say that AI is enabling their innovation. However, just 39Â percent report EBIT impact at the enterprise level.

High performers use AI to drive growth, innovation, and cost:

Eighty percent of respondents say their companies set efficiency as an objective of their AI initiatives, but the companies seeing the most value from AI often set growth or innovation as additional objectives.

Redesigning workflows is a key success factor:

Half of those AI high performers intend to use AI to transform their businesses, and most are redesigning workflows.

Differing perspectives on employment impact:

Respondents vary in their expectations of AIâs impact on the overall workforce size of their organizations in the coming year: 32Â percent expect decreases, 43 percent no change, and 13Â percent increases.

Three years since the introduction of genÂ AI tools

triggered a new era of artificial intelligence, nearly nine out of ten survey respondents say their organizations are regularly using AIâbut the pace of progress remains uneven. While AI tools are now commonplace, most organizations have not yet embedded them deeply enough into their workflows and processes to realize material enterprise-level benefits. The latest McKinsey Global Survey on the state of AI reveals a landscape defined by both wider useâincluding growing proliferation of agentic AIâand stubborn growing pains, with the transition from pilots to scaled impact remaining a work in progress at most organizations.

AI use continues to broaden but remains primarily in pilot phases

Our latest survey shows a larger share of respondents reporting AI use by their organizations, though most have yet to scale the technologies. The share of respondents saying their organizations are using AI in at least one business function has increased since our research last year: 88 percent report regular AI use in at least one business function, compared with 78 percent a year ago. But at the enterprise level, the majority are still in the experimenting or piloting stages (Exhibit 1), with approximately one-third reporting that their companies have begun to scale their AI programs.

Many organizations are already experimenting with AI agents

Organizations are also beginning to explore opportunities with AI agentsâsystems based on foundation models capable of acting in the real world, planning and executing multiple steps in a workflow. Twenty-three percent of respondents report their organizations are scaling an agentic AI system somewhere in their enterprises (that is, expanding the deployment and adoption of the technology within a least one business function), and an additional 39 percent say they have begun experimenting with AI agents. But use of agents is not yet widespread: Most of those who are scaling agents say theyâre only doing so in one or two functions. In any given business function, no more than 10 percent of respondents say their organizations are scaling AI agents (Exhibit 2).

Looking at individual business functions, agent use is most commonly reported in IT and knowledge management, where agentic use cases such as service-desk management in IT and deep research in knowledge management have quickly developed. By industry, the use of AI agents is most widely reported in the technology, media and telecommunications, and healthcare sectors (Exhibit 3).

For most organizations, AI use remains in pilot phases

Reported AI use ticks upward in nearly every industry

In every industry

besides the technology sector (which had already exceeded 90 percent reporting AI use), the share of respondents saying that their organization is regularly using AI in at least one business function has meaningfully increased since our previous survey. In last yearâs research, respondents working for technology companies reported being ahead of other industries with respect to their use of AI. Now, respondents in media and telecommunications and insurance are just as likely as those in tech
