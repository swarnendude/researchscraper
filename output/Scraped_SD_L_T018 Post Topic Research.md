Running large language models (LLMs) on PCs locally is becoming increasingly popular worldwide. In response, AMD is introducing its own LLM application,

Gaia

, an open-source project for running local LLMs on any Windows machine.

Gaia is designed to run various LLM models on Windows PCs and features further performance optimizations for machines equipped with its

Ryzen AI

processors (including the

Ryzen AI Max 395+

). Gaia uses the open-source Lemonade SDK from ONNX TurnkeyML for LLM inference. Models can allegedly adapt for different purposes with Gaia, including summarization and complex reasoning tasks.

Gaia allegedly works through a Retrieval-Augmented Generation agent or RAG. RAG combines an LLM with a knowledge base, allowing the LLM to provide an interactive AI experience for the end-user along with more accurate and contextually aware responses. RAG currently incorporates four Gaia agents: Simple Prompt Completion, an agent designed for direct model interactions intended for testing and evaluation; Chaty, the chatbot portion of an LLM that interacts with the user; Clip, an agent with YouTube search and Q&A functionality; and Joker, a joke generator that adds a humoristic personality to the chatbot.

AMD's new open-source project works by providing LLM-specific tasks through the Lemonade SDK and serving them across multiple runtimes. Lemonade allegedly "exposes an LLM web service that communicates with the GAIA application...via an OpenAI compatible Rest API." Gaia itself acts as an AI-powered agent that retrieves and processes data. It also "vectorizes external content (e.g., GitHub, YouTube, text files) and stores it in a local vector index."

In other words, Gaia can enhance user queries before the LLM processes them, allegedly improving response accuracy and relevance.

The new AI chatbot has two installers: a mainstream installer that works on any Windows PC (whether that PC has AMD hardware or not) and a "Hybrid" installer optimized for Ryzen AI PCs. The latter specifically enables Gaia to run computations on a Ryzen AI CPU's neural processing unit (

NPU

) and integrated graphics for better performance.

Gaia is the latest competitor in the new sea of localized LLM applications, including

LM Studio

and

ChatRTX

. Running an LLM locally has significant advantages over cloud-based solutions, including greater

security

, lower latency, and, in some cases, better performance, depending on the system hardware. Best of all, local LLMs work offline and don't require an internet connection.

AMD really wants a piece of the AI cake, and the 395+ is a good example of it.

Sadly for us, normal users, it looks like resources are being taken out of the gaming part, especially noticeable on nVidia's side, where they've totally wrecked the 5000 gen (melting cables, excessive power draw, broken drivers, missing ROPs, zero efficiency improvement...).

AMD, please keep resources on the gaming part; and Intel, please keep advancing so that nVidia and AMD don't rest on their laurels.

Building AI trust: The key role of explainability

November 26, 2024

| Article

Carlo Giovine

Â Â

Roger Roberts

Mara Pometti

Â Â

Medha Bankhwal

AI systems are powerful but often operate like “black boxes,” shrouded in mystery. Here’s how companies can shed some light and drive adoption of AI solutions that users trust and understand.

(7 pages)

Artificial intelligence

has the potential to deliver

massive gains in economic productivity

Â  and enable

positive social change

around the world. So itâs little surprise that the number of companies adopting AI-powered software, tools, and platforms, including generative AI (gen AI), has

surged throughout 2024

. But that enthusiasm has been accompanied by a fair amount of trepidation: in McKinsey research,

91 percent of respondents doubt their organizations are âvery preparedâ to implement and scale the technology safely and responsibly

.

â

Implementing generative AI with speed and safety

,â

McKinsey Quarterly

, March 13, 2024.

Such doubt is understandable. Along with its potential to boost productivity and innovation, gen AI in particular poses novel risksâfor example, hallucinations and inaccurate or biased outputsâwhich threaten to undermine trust in the technology.

To capture the full potential value of AI, organizations need to build trust. Trust, in fact, is the foundation for adoption of AI-powered products and services. After all, if customers or employees lack trust in the outputs of AI systems, they wonât use them. Trust in AI comes via understanding the outputs of AI-powered software and howâat least at a high levelâthey are created. Organizations increasingly recognize this. In a

McKinsey survey of the state of AI in 2024

, 40 percent of respondents identified explainability as a key risk in adopting gen AI. Yet at the same time, only 17 percent said they were currently working to mitigate it.

2

â

The state of AI in early 2024: Gen AI adoption spikes and starts to generate value

,â McKinsey, May 30, 2024.

This conundrum has raised the need for enhanced AI explainability (XAI)âan emerging approach to building AI systems designed to help organizations understand the inner workings of those systems and monitor the objectivity and accuracy of their outputs. By shedding some light on the complexity of so-called black-box AI algorithms, XAI can increase trust and engagement among those who use AI tools. This is an essential step as AI initiatives make the difficult journey from early use case deployments to scaled, enterprise-wide adoption.

Why invest in this capability: Getting ROI from XAI

As with any investment in an uncertain environment, organizations seeking to enhance AI explainability must consider the benefits and costs to decide how and when to act in the absence of perfect information on the potential upside and risks involved. Todayâs AI landscape is fraught with uncertainty, and in this context, leading AI labs like Anthropic are making bets that investments in XAI will pay off as a path to differentiation in a crowded field of foundation model builders (see sidebar âThe evolution of XAI and todayâs challengesâ). Meanwhile, enterprises are seeking to meet the expectations of their stakeholders and regulators.

The evolution of XAI and today’s challenges

The field of AI

explainability has evolved significantly in recent  years. Early AI tools, employing rule-based systems and decision trees, were relatively simple and transparent by design. However, as machine learning models have grown more complex, it has become more difficult to trace the reasons underpinning their decision-making processes. The early 2000s saw the development of methods like local interpretable model-agnostic explanations (LIME) and Shapley additive explanations (SHAP), which provided insights into individual predictions of complex models. Google introduced its What-If Tool, enhancing model transparency through interactive visualizations; IBM released the AI Explainability 360 tool kit; and DARPA produced an Explainable AI (XAI) program, which further advanced the field by developing comprehensive tool kits and techniques to interpret AI models.

In the meantime, several highly publicized missteps have highlighted the growing need for AI explainability. In 2016, for example,

a ProPublica investigation

into the COMPAS algorithm, used by US courts to assess the likelihood of a defendant reoffending, revealed systematic bias against African American defendants.  Unfortunately, addressing these concerns is no simple matter. One major issue is the increasing complexity of advanced large language models (LLMs), which rely on deep neural networks and often operate as black boxes, with opaque decision-making processes. And the lack of access to the architecture of proprietary models makes it difficult to understand how they operate. Previously, teams could control fairness by curating training data and applying c

Abstract:

India's developer community faces significant barriers to sustained experimentation and learning with commercial Large Language Model (LLM) APIs, primarily due to economic and infrastructural constraints. This study empirically evaluates local LLM deployment using Ollama as an alternative to commercial cloud-based services for developer-focused applications. Through a mixed-methods analysis involving 180 Indian developers, students, and AI enthusiasts, we find that local deployment enables substantially greater hands-on development and experimentation, while reducing costs by 33% compared to commercial solutions. Developers using local LLMs completed over twice as many experimental iterations and reported deeper understanding of advanced AI architectures. Our results highlight local deployment as a critical enabler for inclusive and accessible AI development, demonstrating how technological accessibility can enhance learning outcomes and innovation capacity in resource-constrained environments.

## ✓ What Is a Local LLM: The Complete 2025 Guide to Running AI Models on Your Own Hardware | LocalLLM.in

**URL:** https://localllm.in/blog/what-is-a-local-llm?utm_source=chatgpt.com

What Is a Local LLM: The Complete 2025 Guide to Running AI Models on Your Own Hardware

Running large language models locally has become the cornerstone of private, cost-effective AI deployment in 2025, offering organizations and individuals unprecedented control over their artificial intelligence workflows. Unlike cloud-based solutions that process data on remote servers, local LLMs operate entirely on your own hardware, providing enhanced privacy, reduced long-term costs, and customizable performance that's revolutionizing how we interact with AI technology.

Understanding Local Large Language Models

A local LLM (Large Language Model) is an artificial intelligence system that runs directly on your personal computer, server, or local infrastructure, rather than relying on cloud-based services. These models perform identical functions to their cloud counterparts—generating text, answering questions, writing code, and processing natural language—but execute all computations locally on your hardware.

The fundamental distinction lies in data processing location. When you use ChatGPT or similar cloud services, your prompts travel across the internet to remote servers where processing occurs before results return to your device. Local LLMs eliminate this external dependency entirely, processing everything on your local hardware.

The Open Source and Open-Weight Foundation

Most local LLMs are built upon open source or open-weight models, which represent the backbone of the local AI ecosystem. These models have their parameters (weights) publicly accessible, allowing users to download, modify, and redistribute them without restrictions. The landscape has evolved dramatically in 2025 with groundbreaking releases:

Latest Flagship Models (2025):

Meta's Llama 3.1/3.2 series

- ranging from 8B to 405B parameters with enhanced reasoning capabilities

Alibaba's Qwen3

- featuring hybrid reasoning models from 0.6B to 235B parameters with 119 language support

Google's Gemma 3

- multimodal models (1B-27B) with 128K context and 140+ language support

Zhipu AI's GLM-4.5

- MoE architecture with 355B total/32B active parameters, specialized for agentic tasks

Moonshot AI's Kimi K2

- 1 trillion parameter MoE model with exceptional coding capabilities

OpenAI's GPT-OSS

- recently released 20B and 120B parameter models under Apache 2.0 license

Microsoft's Phi-4 series

- including Phi-4 (14B), Phi-4-mini (3.8B), and Phi-4-mini-flash-reasoning with 10x throughput improvements

Open-weight models differ from fully open-source projects in that they provide access to trained model weights but may not include the complete training code or datasets. This distinction is important for understanding licensing and modification capabilities.

Core Benefits of Local LLM Deployment

Enhanced Privacy and Security

The most compelling advantage of local LLMs is complete data sovereignty. Every prompt, document, and piece of sensitive information remains within your infrastructure, eliminating risks of data breaches during transmission or unauthorized access by third-party providers. This approach is particularly crucial for industries handling sensitive information such as healthcare, finance, and legal services.

For businesses operating under strict regulatory frameworks like GDPR, HIPAA, or FERPA, local LLMs provide compliance-by-design solutions. Patient records, financial data, and proprietary business information never leave the organization's controlled environment, significantly simplifying regulatory adherence.

Cost-Effectiveness for High-Volume Usage

While local LLMs require substantial upfront hardware investment, they often prove more economical for organizations with consistent AI processing demands. Cloud-based solutions typically charge per token processed—costs that can escalate rapidly with high usage volumes.

Updated 2025 analysis indicates that local deployments can deliver 30-70% cost savings over 18-24 months when utilization exceeds moderate usage levels. For enterprises processing thousands of queries daily, eliminating recurring API fees represents significant long-term savings. Current cloud pricing ranges from $0.15 to $75 per million tokens, while local hardware costs $5K-50K upfront depending on requirements.

Ultra-Low Latency Performance

Local processing eliminates network-dependent delays inherent in cloud solutions. Response times improve dramatically when models process requests directly on local hardware rather than sending data across internet connections to remote servers.

This performance advantage proves critical for real-time applications such as:

Live customer support chatbots

Voice assistants requiring instant responses

Code completion tools used during development

Real-time translation services

Edge AI applications in autonomous vehicles

Studies show local LLMs can achieve response times under 100ms compared to 200ms-5s for cloud-based alternatives depending on network conditions.

Now let’s dive into the details.

How Did We Get Here? The Evolution of LLMs and What’s Coming in 2026

Large language models went from research curiosities to powerful foundation models in less than a decade. The early 2020s saw GPT‑3 and GPT‑4 generating natural dialogue, summarizing documents and writing code. But by 2025, the conversation shifted from

“Which model is best?” to “How do we integrate LLMs reliably with up‑to‑date knowledge, cost efficiency and safety?”

. This shift reflects the maturity of the ecosystem: dozens of proprietary and open models, specialized designs and new ways to combine them through

retrieval‑augmented generation (RAG)

and

fine‑tuning

.

Several trends set the stage for 2026:

Multimodal models

can parse text, images, audio and even video. Zapier’s analysis notes that

reasoning models and large multimodal models (LMMs) are the two most important developments

. Companies like Google (Gemini), OpenAI and Mistral are racing to offer native multimodal support.

Extended context windows

: Models like GPT‑4 Turbo and Claude 3 Sonnet handle hundreds of pages of text. Next‑generation models promise context windows up to

200 k tokens

or beyond, enabling them to read entire knowledge bases or code repositories.

Mixture‑of‑experts (MoE) architectures

: Instead of activating all parameters at once, MoE models route queries through specialist “experts,” providing a strong price–performance trade‑off. Mistral Large 2 uses this architecture to offer

efficient inference at competitive cost

.

Parameter‑efficient tuning

: Fine‑tuning with LoRA and QLoRA attaches small layers to base models, reducing compute cost while achieving domain‑specific performance. This technique is now widely adopted in enterprise deployments.

Agentic and autonomous AI

: Deloitte’s 2026 insights classify

agentic AI

as a key trend—these systems

plan and execute multi‑step processes

. They go beyond chatbots by taking actions (e.g., drafting and filing a report) without constant human supervision.

Edge and sovereign AI

: Lightweight models like Gemini Nano bring powerful capabilities to smart

Trend Alert: Local AI 🤖

from the

newsletter

You pay for centralized AI tools that tell you what you can and cannot do, while saving your documents and innermost thoughts on their servers.

Local AI gives you more control over your data and usage. It becomes your advisor, not a supervisor.

Players

Local AI models:

Llama 3

: Local AI model from Meta.

Gemma

: Open source AI models from Google.

Qwen2

: Open source model.

DeepSeek Coder

: AI models that write, understand, and complete code.

Stable Diffusion

: Text-to-image generation model for photo realistic images.

Opportunities

Build privacy-first, client-side apps. Privacy is a strong selling point for sensitive use cases.

Build a user-friendly interface to help non-technical users connect, train, and use local AI. Great UI leads to great UX.

Make tutorials to help people build, run, and use local AI models.

Predictions

We'll see virtual companies of AI agents that work together locally.

We'll be able to build AI apps visually, without code. This will let non-technical users build complex apps for their workflows.

Lack of censorship will become a better selling point. Users will prefer unfiltered creativity over censored tools that refuse to do controversial, yet legal, tasks.

Risks

Hardware requirements: If you're serious about running AI models locally, you may need to buy a new computer. Depending on your needs and preferences, this may cost a few thousand dollars.

UX issues: You may not be able to use multiple models simultaneously. You can open ChatGPT, Claude, and Gemini in different tabs, but running more than one local AI model, with billions of parameters, can be impossible.

Key lessons

The performance gap between local and cloud AI is closing.

Local AI is self-sufficient. You can ask for help anytime, anywhere, as long as you have your device with you. No internet connection required.

Hot takes

Governments will regulate local AI on par with centralized models. They still

pose risks

, similar to proprietary models.

China will beat the US in the AI race. Chinese open source models

already beat

open source models from the US. Eventually, Chinese proprietary models will catch up, too. The US will try to limit public access to AI research.

Such concerns have already been stated

.

Haters

"I need more expensive, powerful hardware to run local AI models."

This is the main tradeoff for local AI at the moment, but it's becoming more performant. See how llama.cpp lets you run them on consumer devices, and how Apple is doing this on a grand scale. This may be an inflection point for hardware and local AI.

"Setup and onboarding is hard. I can't just visit a URL."

User experience with local AI is a solvable problem. We're getting there with open source tools that make setting up local AI easier. Ollama lets you set up Llama 3 in 10 minutes.

"Local AI models perform worse than AI models made by tech giants."

Open source AI models can be a little worse, but a lot more private and less censored. Depending on your use case, it can be wise to sacrifice quality for privacy.

"Providing support for models running locally sounds impossible."

This is another tradeoff of local LLMs. Unless the model becomes unusable, users can use an AI model to debug another AI model.

This guy

uses local AI models as copilots for coding copilots.

"Local AI models aren't a panacea for AI-related data privacy issues."

This is the risk of storing data in digital form. "Private" local AI may not protect your data if your computer is compromised.

Self-Hosting LLMs: What Companies Need to Know

Self-hosted AI is gaining momentum. With powerful LLMs from Meta, Google, DeepSeek, and OpenAI now freely available for download, running AI models on your own infrastructure has never been more appealing. But companies that overlook differences in licensing, usage rights, or governance may face serious legal and financial risks. This article breaks down the key considerations for organizations exploring self-hosted LLMs.

What this post is about

Self-Hosting: difference between Open Source and Open Weights

Which licensing risks companies often overlook

Why true open-source AI offers greater long-term security

How to choose the right model for your organization’s needs

As increasingly powerful language models become widely accessible, more companies are looking for ways to integrate AI into their internal processes securely and in compliance with data protection requirements. In industries that handle sensitive information or operate under strict regulatory frameworks, self-hosting is rapidly moving into focus. Running AI models on your own infrastructure unlocks new possibilities — but it also raises fundamental questions around licensing, governance, and technical responsibility.

Why Local LLMs Are Gaining Traction

Self-hosting primarily means having full control over your data, infrastructure, and model operations. For many organizations — especially in public administration, healthcare, or critical infrastructure — this level of control is essential.

At the same time, midsize companies and start-ups are discovering that self-hosting unlocks a range of practical, day-to-day benefits that go far beyond compliance:

Data control

: Complete oversight of all data flows, with zero risk of third parties accessing or reusing training data.

Cost control

: No surprise price hikes. Operating costs remain predictable over the long term.

Independence

: Freedom from vendor lock-in and API limitations, enabling long-term strategic planning.

Customizability

: Models can be finely tuned for specific use cases without creating new external dependencies.

Self-hosting offers significant advantages — but only if the chosen model genuinely aligns with your organization’s needs.

The Fundamental Distinction: Open Source vs. Open Weights

Self-hosting an LLM doesn’t automatically mean you’re working with free or open software. A range of terms is used in this space, many of which sound similar but come with very different legal and technical implications once you look closer.

Open-source models make all essential components publicly available: the training code, infrastructure, architecture, weights, and detailed documentation of the training data. This level of transparency makes the models fully reproducible and auditable. Companies can understand how the model was built, why it behaves the way it does, and where its limitations may lie — enabling more informed decision-making. While genuinely open-source LLMs remain rare, the first Apache- and MIT-licensed models already demonstrate what this level of openness can look like in practice.

Open-weights models, by contrast, usually publish only the final weights. The training code and datasets remain closed, and their use is often governed by license terms that users must accept before downloading. Meta’s Llama models and many models on Hugging Face fall into this category. They can be cost-effective alternatives to proprietary APIs, but they do not offer the full transparency that true open-source models provide.

For companies, this distinction is crucial: it determines how well a model can be audited, which licensing obligations apply in practice, and how stable the legal framework will be in the long run.

Licensing: Where Most Self-Hosting Risks Originate

Even if model weights are not currently considered copyright-protected under many legal interpretations, they still create binding contractual obligations.

Downloading an open-weights model almost always means accepting the manufacturer’s license — and that license may impose specific requirements. These can include restrictions on commercial use, attribution obligations, or the need to include license information when redistributing the model.

Some providers, such as Meta with Llama, also enforce “Acceptable Use Policies” that may limit fine-tuning or certain applications. Violating these terms can lead to contractual penalties, mandatory data deletion, or claims for damages.

In practice, this means that anyone self-hosting an LLM should fully understand the legal framework governing its use before deployment. Doing so helps avoid misunderstandings and prevents situations where a model must be removed after it is already in production.

The Advantage of True Open-Source AI

True open-source models — as defined by the

Open Source Initiative

(OSI) — offer more than just access to source code

Edge AI and CDC: Powering Enterprises with Low-Latency Analytics

08 May 2025

1K views

2 mins read

In a world where milliseconds matter, enterprises need real-time insights to drive efficiency and growth. Edge AI, paired with Change Data Capture (CDC), delivers low-latency analytics by processing data at the source—on IoT devices, sensors, or gateways. This powerful combination enables instant decision-making, reduces cloud dependency, and optimizes costs, making it a game-changer for businesses. From smart factories to logistics, Edge AI and CDC are transforming how enterprises leverage IoT data processing.

This blog explores their synergy, a real-world use case, and how your business can harness this technology for measurable outcomes.

Why Edge AI and CDC Matter

Edge AI deploys machine learning models on edge devices, processing data locally to minimize latency and bandwidth usage. Unlike cloud-based AI, which requires data to travel to centralized servers, Edge AI delivers insights in milliseconds, ideal for time-sensitive applications.

CDC, meanwhile, captures incremental database changes (e.g., inventory updates, sensor readings) and streams them in real time to downstream systems, ensuring data freshness.

Together, Edge AI and CDC enable enterprises to:

Stream real-time data changes from databases to edge devices using CDC.

Process these streams locally with AI models for instant insights.

Act on results without cloud delays, enhancing operational agility.

Gartner predicts that by 2026, 75% of enterprise data will be processed at the edge, reflecting surging investments in IoT and real-time use cases in 2025. For North American firms, this technology addresses critical needs: speed, compliance, and cost efficiency.

Business Relevance and Pain Points Addressed

Edge AI and CDC tackle key enterprise challenges:

Latency in Decision-Making:

Cloud-based analytics introduce delays, hindering applications like predictive maintenance or real-time fraud detection. Edge AI processes CDC streams locally, delivering insights in under 50 milliseconds.

High Cloud Costs:

Streaming massive IoT data to the cloud spikes bandwidth expenses. Edge AI reduces cloud dependency, cutting costs by up to 40% (McKinsey).

Data Privacy and Compliance:

Local processing aligns with U.S. regulations like CCPA and HIPAA, minimizing data exposure.

Network Reliability:

Edge AI operates offline, ensuring resilience in remote or unstable network environments.

ROI:

Edge AI can boost operational efficiency by 15–25% in industries like manufacturing, while reducing downtime and optimizing resource use. For example, a smart factory using Edge AI with CDC can cut defect-related losses by 20%, delivering millions in savings annually.

Market Appeal:

U.S. enterprises in IoT-heavy sectors, such as manufacturing, logistics, healthcare, and retail are adopting Edge AI to meet customer demands for instant services (e.g., same-day delivery) and comply with stringent data privacy laws. The technology’s ability to scale across thousands of edge devices makes it ideal for large-scale operations.

Industries Leveraging Edge AI and CDC

Edge AI and CDC are transforming manufacturing, logistics, healthcare, and retail industries.

How Edge AI Processes CDC Streams: Smart Factory Example

In a smart factory, Edge AI and CDC can enable real-time monitoring of production lines. Here’s how they can integrate, using a manufacturing plant with a MySQL database tracking inventory, machine performance, and quality metrics:

1. CDC Streams Data:

A CDC tool like Debezium monitors the database’s transaction log, capturing changes (e.g., new sensor readings, inventory updates).

These changes are streamed via Apache Kafka to edge devices on the factory floor, ensuring real-time data delivery.

2. Edge AI Analyzes Streams:

Edge devices run lightweight AI models, such as neural networks for anomaly detection, optimized with TensorFlow Lite.

The models process CDC streams locally, analyzing metrics like vibration or temperature to detect defects in under 50 milliseconds.

3. Real-Time Actions:

If a defect is flagged, the AI triggers an alert to pause the production line, preventing faulty output.

Non-critical data is synced to the cloud for long-term analytics, maintaining efficiency.

This setup ensures low-latency analytics, critical for high-speed manufacturing environments.

[D]  Classification of low resource language using Deep learning

I have been trying to solve classification problem on a low resource language. I am doing comparative analysis, LinearSVC and Logistic regression performed the best and the only models with 80+ accuracy and no overfitting. I have to classify it using deep learning model as well. I applied BERT on the dataset, model is 'bert-base-multilingual-cased', and I am fine tuning it, but issue is overfitting.

Training logs:

Epoch 6/10 | Train Loss: 0.4135 | Train Acc: 0.8772 | Val Loss: 0.9208 | Val Acc: 0.7408

Epoch 7/10 | Train Loss: 0.2984 | Train Acc: 0.9129 | Val Loss: 0.8313 | Val Acc: 0.7530

Epoch 8/10 | Train Loss: 0.2207 | Train Acc: 0.9388 | Val Loss: 0.8720 | Val Acc: 0.7505

this was with default dropout of the model, when I change dropout to 0.3, or even 0.2, model still overfits but not this much, but with dropout I don't go near 60% accuracy, long training introduces overfitting, early stopping isn't working as val loss continuous to decrease. On 10 epoch, I trained patience of 2 and 3. It doesn't stops. To prevent this I am not doing warmup step, my optimizer is below:

optimizer = AdamW([

{'params': model.bert.parameters(), 'lr': 2e-5},

{'params': model.classifier.parameters(), 'lr': 3e-5}

], weight_decay=0.01)

About my dataset,

I have 9000 training samples and 11 classes to train, data is imbalanced but not drastically, to cater this I have added class weights to loss function.

17 words per training sample on average. I set the max_length to 120 for tokens ids and attention masks.

How can I improve my training, I am trying to achieve atleast 75% accuracy without overfitting, for my comparative analysis. What I am doing wrong? Please guide me.

Data Augmentation didn't work too. I did easy data augmentation. Mixup Augmentation also didn't work.

If you need more information about my training to answer questions, ask in the comment, thanks.

How do I run AI locally? And what is the most efficient model / software?

Hey everyone. I'll admit - Sam Altman and Open AI just give me a really bad gut feeling. And to be honest, even if they're good intentioned and truly do care about the well being of people and try their best to keep conversations private, someone could just hack the server and leak out whatever users have. He also will be forced to if a frivolous law or court case is filed give data over to people who may not have the best intentions or may abuse a moral panic such as children's safety or mental health for purposes of power. Don't get me wrong, these issues need to be cared about - but they're often used as a trojan horse by politicians to abuse power.

And now with them giving up this data to the police automatically - I am more concerned. Police departments are rife with corruption and abuses of power, so are courts. Etc.

But this technology is

amazing.

I think when used

properly

- as a tool to help people out, let people learn and be more creative, it could very well better humanity. I was curious. What software can I use to emulate this on my own hardware? I've tried out Ollama, but I've heard that this isn't the most up to date though I'm still fucking amazed. And which model is best and most advanced / best for local? I'm a total noob at this.

The state of AI in 2025: Agents, innovation, and transformation

November 5, 2025

| Survey

Almost all survey respondents say their organizations are using AI, and many have begun to use AI agents. But most are still in the early stages of scaling AI and capturing enterprise-level value.

(30 pages)

Key findings

Most organizations are still in the experimentation or piloting phase:

Nearly two-thirds of respondents say their organizations have not yet begun scaling AI across the enterprise.

High curiosity in AI agents:

Sixty-two percent of survey respondents say their organizations are at least experimenting with AI agents.

Positive leading indicators on impact of AI:

Respondents report use-case-level cost and revenue benefits, and 64 percent say that AI is enabling their innovation. However, just 39Â percent report EBIT impact at the enterprise level.

High performers use AI to drive growth, innovation, and cost:

Eighty percent of respondents say their companies set efficiency as an objective of their AI initiatives, but the companies seeing the most value from AI often set growth or innovation as additional objectives.

Redesigning workflows is a key success factor:

Half of those AI high performers intend to use AI to transform their businesses, and most are redesigning workflows.

Differing perspectives on employment impact:

Respondents vary in their expectations of AIâs impact on the overall workforce size of their organizations in the coming year: 32Â percent expect decreases, 43 percent no change, and 13Â percent increases.

Three years since the introduction of genÂ AI tools

triggered a new era of artificial intelligence, nearly nine out of ten survey respondents say their organizations are regularly using AIâbut the pace of progress remains uneven. While AI tools are now commonplace, most organizations have not yet embedded them deeply enough into their workflows and processes to realize material enterprise-level benefits. The latest McKinsey Global Survey on the state of AI reveals a landscape defined by both wider useâincluding growing proliferation of agentic AIâand stubborn growing pains, with the transition from pilots to scaled impact remaining a work in progress at most organizations.

AI use continues to broaden but remains primarily in pilot phases

Our latest survey shows a larger share of respondents reporting AI use by their organizations, though most have yet to scale the technologies. The share of respondents saying their organizations are using AI in at least one business function has increased since our research last year: 88 percent report regular AI use in at least one business function, compared with 78 percent a year ago. But at the enterprise level, the majority are still in the experimenting or piloting stages (Exhibit 1), with approximately one-third reporting that their companies have begun to scale their AI programs.

Many organizations are already experimenting with AI agents

Organizations are also beginning to explore opportunities with AI agentsâsystems based on foundation models capable of acting in the real world, planning and executing multiple steps in a workflow. Twenty-three percent of respondents report their organizations are scaling an agentic AI system somewhere in their enterprises (that is, expanding the deployment and adoption of the technology within a least one business function), and an additional 39 percent say they have begun experimenting with AI agents. But use of agents is not yet widespread: Most of those who are scaling agents say theyâre only doing so in one or two functions. In any given business function, no more than 10 percent of respondents say their organizations are scaling AI agents (Exhibit 2).

Looking at individual business functions, agent use is most commonly reported in IT and knowledge management, where agentic use cases such as service-desk management in IT and deep research in knowledge management have quickly developed. By industry, the use of AI agents is most widely reported in the technology, media and telecommunications, and healthcare sectors (Exhibit 3).

For most organizations, AI use remains in pilot phases

Reported AI use ticks upward in nearly every industry

In every industry

besides the technology sector (which had already exceeded 90 percent reporting AI use), the share of respondents saying that their organization is regularly using AI in at least one business function has meaningfully increased since our previous survey. In last yearâs research, respondents working for technology companies reported being ahead of other industries with respect to their use of AI. Now, respondents in media and telecommunications and insurance are just as likely as those in tech

How do i install and use AI locally?

i am looking for a way to create images with ai. it is important to me that the ai has no restrictions and that i can use the images freely. it would also be important that i can use ai to combine two images into one edit. i really have no experience with ai programs. i also do not want to use browser-based apps, but rather have the tool installed on my own pc (12 gb vram). however, i have no idea what to use or how to install such things snd the web is full of scam and shady stuff. maybe someone can help me with that? where do i even start? i do not even know what all the names like stable diffusion or dalle are about, or what they are called exactly. thank you so much!

Benefits to Self Hosting

Self-hosting AI tools refers to running large language models (LLMs) and other machine learning systems on personal or institutional hardware rather than relying on cloud-based services. This approach provides greater control over data, customization, and cost.

Data Privacy and Security

Self-hosting allows researchers to keep sensitive data on local machines or secure servers, mitigating risks associated with sending data to third-party services. This is especially important when working with proprietary datasets, health records, or confidential research findings. For example, a healthcare researcher analyzing patient intake forms for language patterns can use a local LLM without violating HIPAA.

Cost Efficiency

While there may be upfront hardware costs (e.g., a high-RAM laptop or workstation), self-hosted models eliminate recurring cloud subscription fees or per-token charges associated with commercial APIs. Over time, researchers running frequent or batch workloads—such as summarizing hundreds of articles or transcribing interviews—can save significantly.

Customization and Control

Users can fine-tune models on their own datasets, integrate AI workflows with existing tools like Zotero or Jupyter, and use models offline. This flexibility enables reproducible research pipelines. For instance, a social sciences team could create a custom LLM trained on their interview transcripts and use it consistently across multiple projects without risking cloud variability.

Accessibility in Low-Connectivity Environments

Offline access ensures researchers in remote field sites, rural universities, or bandwidth-constrained settings can still use powerful AI tools. A conservationist analyzing field reports in the Amazon, or an education researcher working in a rural community without reliable internet, could both benefit from self-hosted tools that function without live cloud access. Offline access ensures researchers in remote or bandwidth-limited areas can still use powerful AI tools
