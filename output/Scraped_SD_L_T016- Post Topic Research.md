Lots of engineers reach out to me with their Profiles.

In most cases these are half baked and lack many important things.

Engineers in 2026 won't be hired for syntax. They'll be hired for leverage.

𝐘𝐨𝐮𝐫 𝐯𝐚𝐥𝐮𝐞 = 𝐡𝐨𝐰 𝐦𝐮𝐜𝐡 𝐨𝐮𝐭𝐜𝐨𝐦𝐞 𝐲𝐨𝐮 𝐜𝐫𝐞𝐚𝐭𝐞 𝐩𝐞𝐫 𝐮𝐧𝐢𝐭 𝐞𝐟𝐟𝐨𝐫𝐭.

You should clearly learn and build most of the below stuff -

- 𝐀𝐥-𝐧𝐚𝐭𝐢𝐯𝐞 𝐬𝐲𝐬𝐭𝐞𝐦 𝐝𝐞𝐬𝐢𝐠𝐧:  Stop "adding Al". Start designing systems where LLMs are first-class citizens: Agents, tool calling, feedback loops, guardrails. Understand in-depth

- 𝐏𝐫𝐨𝐦𝐩𝐭𝐢𝐧𝐠 + 𝐑𝐀𝐆 + 𝐀𝐠𝐞𝐧𝐭𝐬

Hard truth: If you can't ground LLMs with your own data, you're just demo-ing.

Learn: embeddings, chunking, retrieval, evaluation, hallucination control.

- 𝐂𝐥𝐨𝐮𝐝 𝐜𝐨𝐬𝐭 & 𝐩𝐞𝐫𝐟𝐨𝐫𝐦𝐚𝐧𝐜𝐞 𝐞𝐧𝐠𝐢𝐧𝐞𝐞𝐫𝐢𝐧𝐠: Your job isn't "scale it". Your job is scale it profitably. Learn FinOps, capacity modelling, cold-start analysis, infra trade-offs(super important).

- 𝐃𝐢𝐬𝐭𝐫𝐢𝐛𝐮𝐭𝐞𝐝 𝐬𝐲𝐬𝐭𝐞𝐦𝐬 𝐟𝐮𝐧𝐝𝐚𝐦𝐞𝐧𝐭𝐚𝐥𝐬 :

CAP, consistency models, replication, sharding, backpressure. Because every "simple" system becomes distributed at scale.

- 𝐒𝐞𝐜𝐮𝐫𝐢𝐭𝐲 𝐛𝐲 𝐝𝐞𝐬𝐢𝐠𝐧:  Secrets, IAM, least privilege, threat modelling,RBAC. Security isn't a team. It's a habit.

- 𝐃𝐚𝐭𝐚 + 𝐩𝐫𝐨𝐝𝐮𝐜𝐭 𝐭𝐡𝐢𝐧𝐤𝐢𝐧𝐠:

Logs → metrics → features → revenue. If you don't understand business impact, you'll always be a cost center.

- 𝐖𝐫𝐢𝐭𝐢𝐧𝐠 & 𝐜𝐨𝐦𝐦𝐮𝐧𝐢𝐜𝐚𝐭𝐢𝐨𝐧:The rarest engineering skill: clarity. If you can't explain your system, you don't own it. Tools will change. Models will change.

Your thinking must scale faster than both

Creating and managing organization resources

Stay organized with collections

Save and categorize content based on your preferences.

The organization resource is the root node in the

Google Cloud resource hierarchy

and is the hierarchical super node of projects. This page explains how to

acquire and manage an organization resource.

Note:

From early 2024, every organization resource you create will automatically

have a set of organization policies enforced on it. For more information, see

Google Cloud security baseline constraints

.

Before you begin

Read an

overview

of the organization resource.

Getting an organization resource

An organization resource is available for Google Workspace and Cloud Identity customers:

Google Workspace:

Sign up for

Google Workspace

.

Cloud Identity:

Sign up for

Cloud Identity

.

Once you have created your Google Workspace or Cloud Identity account and associated it with a

domain, your organization resource will be automatically created for you. The resource will be

provisioned at different times depending on your account status:

If you are new to Google Cloud and have not created a project yet, the

organization resource will be created for you when you log in to the

Google Cloud console and accept the terms and conditions.

If you are an existing Google Cloud user, the organization resource will

be created for you when you create a new project or billing account. Any projects you created

previously will be listed under "No organization", and this is normal. The organization

resource will appear and the new project you created will be linked to it automatically.

You will need to move any projects you created under "No organization" into your new

organization resource. For instructions on how to move your projects, see

Migrating projects into an organization resource

.

The organization resource that is created will be linked to your Google Workspace or

Cloud Identity account with the project or billing account you created set as a child resource.

All projects and billing accounts created under your Google Workspace or Cloud Identity domain

will be children of this organization resource.

For information about how to migrate pre-existing projects, see

Migrating existing projects

.

Each Google Workspace or Cloud Identity account is associated with exactly

one organization resource. An organization resource is associated with exactly

one domain, which is set when the organization resource is created.

Important:

When the organization resource is created, we communicate its availability to

the Google Workspace or Cloud Identity super admins. These

super administrator accounts

should be used carefully because they have a lot of control

over your organization resource and all the resources underneath it. For this reason, we

recommend against using Google Workspace or Cloud Identity super administrator accounts

for day-to-day management of your organization resource. For more information about using

Google Workspace or Cloud Identity super administrator accounts in Google Cloud,

see

Super administrator account best practices

.

To actively adopt the organization resource, the Google Workspace or

Cloud Identity super admins need to assign the

Organization Administrator

(

roles/resourcemanager.organizationAdmin

) Identity and Access Management (IAM) role to a

user or group. For steps on setting up your organization resource, see

Setting up your organization resource

.

When the organization resource is created, all users in your domain are automatically

granted Project Creator (

roles/resourcemanager.projectCreator

) and

Billing Account Creator (

roles/billing.creator

) IAM roles

at the organization resource level. This enables users in your domain to continue

creating projects with no disruption.

The Organization Administrator will decide when they want to start

actively using the organization resource. They can then change the default

permissions and enforce more restrictive policies as needed.

If the organization resource is available and you don't have the IAM

permissions to view it, you can still create projects and billing accounts.

These are automatically created under the organization resource, even if you

can't see it.

Note:

There is a second way to obtain an organization resource: a standalone organization

is automatically created for users when they sign up for a Google Account. For

more information, see the

documentation

on standalone organizations.

Google Cloud security baseline

Google Cloud security baseline addresses insecure security postures with a bundle of organization

policies that are enforced when an organization resource is created. These

constraints are automatically created and enforced on your organization when it

is created. For information about viewing and managing these constraints,

see

Google Cloud

## ✓ Demystifying evals for AI agents \ Anthropic

**URL:** https://www.anthropic.com/engineering/demystifying-evals-for-ai-agents

Introduction

Good evaluations help teams ship AI agents more confidently. Without them, it’s easy to get stuck in reactive loops—catching issues only in production, where fixing one failure creates others. Evals make problems and behavioral changes visible before they affect users, and their value compounds over the lifecycle of an agent.

As we described in

Building effective agents

, agents operate over many turns: calling tools, modifying state, and adapting based on intermediate results. These same capabilities that make AI agents useful—autonomy, intelligence, and flexibility—also make them harder to evaluate.

Through our internal work and with customers at the frontier of agent development, we’ve learned how to design more rigorous and useful evals for agents. Here's what's worked across a range of agent architectures and use cases in real-world deployment.

The structure of an evaluation

An

evaluation

(“eval”) is a test for an AI system: give an AI an input, then apply grading logic to its output to measure success. In this post, we focus on

automated evals

that can be run during development without real users.

Single-turn evaluations

are straightforward: a prompt, a response, and grading logic. For earlier LLMs, single-turn, non-agentic evals were the main evaluation method. As AI capabilities have advanced,

multi-turn evaluations

have become increasingly common.

In a simple eval, an agent processes a prompt, and a grader checks if the output matches expectations. For a more complex multi-turn eval, a coding agent receives tools, a task (building an MCP server in this case), and an environment, executes an "agent loop" (tool calls and reasoning), and updates the environment with the implementation. Grading then uses unit tests to verify the working MCP server.

Agent evaluations

are even more complex. Agents use tools across many turns, modifying state in the environment and adapting as they go—which means mistakes can propagate and compound. Frontier models can also find creative solutions that surpass the limits of static evals. For instance, Opus 4.5 solved a

𝜏2-bench

problem about booking a flight by

discovering

a loophole in the policy. It “failed” the evaluation as written, but actually came up with a better solution for the user.

When building agent evaluations, we use the following definitions:

A

task

(a.k.a

problem

or

test case

) is a single test with defined inputs and success criteria.

Each attempt at a task is a

trial

. Because model outputs vary between runs, we run multiple trials to produce more consistent results.

A

grader

is logic that scores some aspect of the agent’s performance. A task can have multiple graders, each containing multiple assertions (sometimes called

checks

)

.

A

transcript

(also called a

trace

or

trajectory

) is the complete record of a trial, including outputs, tool calls, reasoning, intermediate results, and any other interactions. For the Anthropic API, this is the full messages array at the end of an eval run - containing all the calls to the API and all of the returned responses during the evaluation.

The

outcome

is the final state in the environment at the end of the trial. A flight-booking agent might say “Your flight has been booked” at the end of the transcript, but the outcome is whether a reservation exists in the environment’s SQL database.

An

evaluation harness

is the infrastructure that runs evals end-to-end. It provides instructions and tools, runs tasks concurrently, records all the steps, grades outputs, and aggregates results.

An

agent harness

(or

scaffold

) is the system that enables a model to act as an agent: it processes inputs, orchestrates tool calls, and returns results. When we evaluate “an agent,” we’re evaluating the harness

and

the model working together. For example,

Claude Code

is a flexible agent harness, and we used its core primitives through the

Agent SDK

to build our

long-running agent harness

.

An

evaluation suite

is a collection of tasks designed to measure specific capabilities or behaviors. Tasks in a suite typically share a broad goal. For instance, a customer support eval suite might test refunds, cancellations, and escalations.

Components of evaluations for agents.

Why build evaluations?

When teams first start building agents, they can get surprisingly far through a combination of manual testing,

dogfooding

, and intuition. More rigorous evaluation may even seem like overhead that slows down shipping. But after the early prototyping stages, once an agent is in production and has started scaling, building without evals starts to break down.

The breaking point often comes when users report the agent feels worse after changes, and the team is ‘flying blind’ with no way to verify except to guess and check. Absent evals, debugging is reactive: wait for complaints, reproduce manually, fix the bug, and hope nothing else regressed. Teams can't distinguish real

Depending on which study you believe, and what industry you’re in, acquiring a new customer is anywhere from five to 25 times more expensive than retaining an existing one. It makes sense: you don’t have to spend time and resources going out and finding a new client — you just have to keep the one you have happy. If you’re not convinced that retaining customers is so valuable, consider

research done by Frederick Reichheld of Bain & Company

(the inventor of the

net promoter score

) that shows increasing customer retention rates by 5% increases profits by 25% to 95%.

Learning AI engineering in 2026

I’m currently working as a full-stack developer with a strong focus on backend microservices and system design. Lately, I’ve been thinking about my future and the direction I want to take. I came across some AI engineer positions that require familiarity with backend systems, DevOps, and ML model training. I always thought roles like these were rare because of the “one-skill specialist” mentality in the development world.

Is it a good idea to start learning DevOps and AI engineering to open up future job opportunities? Or would it be better to stick to one specialized area instead?

Hoping to meet your cofounder? As a followup to my

post about getting a technical cofounder

, I thought I'd offer a near-exhaustive list of places where you can find potential cofounders — technical or no. Let's get right into it.

Meeting cofounders in person

Friends, family, acquaintances, friends of friends, etc.

: This is the obvious place to start. It's where I've found literally every cofounder I've ever had (~11 and counting).

Old colleagues

: Yes, this could go in the "acquaintances" bucket above but colleagues might be an even safer bet. After all, you have experience working together and they're (presumably) in your industry.

Co-working spaces

: What better place to meet other entrepreneurs? Check out

WeWork

. Even better, find your local indie co-working space like @alexhillman's

Indie Hall

in Philadelphia (currently online) or @charlierward's online co-working group,

Weekend Club

.

Startup Weekend

: Speaking of weekends, Techstars Startup Weekend is a worldwide, three-day event where entrepreneurs, pitch, validate, build, and demo their prototypes. It is a perfect place to meet like-minded people eager to start new businesses.

Meetups

: This is a no-brainer. Find meetups in your industry and strike up some conversations.

Hackathons

: If you're looking for a

technical

cofounder, these are good places to be. Here's a

list of sites

to keep an eye on for upcoming hackathons.

Conferences

: These can cost a pretty penny but if it's a niche conference, you can definitely find good candidates. Check out

MicroConf

, for one.

Local university entrepreneur activities

: I spent a lot of time at these in college. I also acted as a panelist for a competition after graduating.  I can tell you that I met a lot of interesting people this way.

Networking

: It can be scary but it can also be worth it. Target networking events in your niche or for a specific skill set (like marketing events).

Incubators

:  If you get into an incubator, you'll meet lots of people with that entrepreneurial spirit. And if you're not quite that far along, many have communities for early-stage folks to communicate. Here's a

list of some of the best

.

Founder dating events

: I've never been to one but some places offer speed-dating for founders from time to time. Keep your ear to the ground.

Meeting cofounders online

Indie Hackers

: Obviously this is a great place to do it. And you're already here, so that's convenient. Get active, and check out the

Looking to Partner Up

group, which has nearly 16,000 members.

Building in public

: This shows people who you are and what you're made of. Boost your signal by building in public, and either cofounders will come to you or you can put out the call when you're ready.

LinkedIn

: Your personal network on LinkedIn is an asset. But you can also check out LinkedIn groups like

On Startups - The Community for Entrepreneurs

,

CoFounder

, and

Ideas Seeking Co Founder

.

Freelancers

: Many of us have worked as freelancers at some point. If you hire someone to work on your MVP, who's to say that they won't want to join in on the indie hacking fun? It wouldn't be the first time.

CoFoundersLab

: This is a free platform specifically designed for connecting entrepreneurs.

Founders Nation

: This is another free platform that connects people with cofounders.

Pozi.io

: This is a platform currently in Beta that aims to connect and inspire entrepreneurs.

FoundersBeta

: This is a paid platform for finding startup jobs, cofounders, events, and ultimately growing your network.

StartHawk

: This is essentially a dating app for cofounders. Sign up for free and search cofounders using their algorithm, then chat to see if it's a good fit.

F6S

: A free platform with over 4 million users. F6S lets you connect with accelerators, funds, investors — you name it. More to the point, they'll let you post a position at your startup.

Lead Candy

: Lead Candy is a paid platform that helps you search out entrepreneurs, cofounders, industry leaders, etc., but it's a little different from the rest in that it lets you connect with them via their socials and verified email addresses.

AngelList

: You’ve probably already heard of it. It’s not specifically designed for finding cofounders but, like F6S, you can just register as a recruiter and post a position.

reddit

: reddit is a place you'll definitely want to check out.  And with 23,000 members looking for cofounders, it's well worth joining

r/cofounder

. Also worth checking out:

r/startups

,

r/Entrepreneur

,

r/EntrepreneurRideAlong

,  and

r/SideProject

Slack

: You're probably familiar with this messaging platform and its many business channels. Here's a

list of 400 channels

to get you started.

Discord

: Check out Discord too, and specifically their #cofounding channel in /r/startups.

And then, of course, there's social media. Don’t underestimate the power of a g

One day, the Guggenheim will hang this on its walls. Just wait.

If I had a dollar for every time someone asked me for a roadmap to becoming an ML/AI Engineer from scratch … well, let’s just say I’d have a very full coffee fund by now 😅

And honestly? I get it.

Breaking into AI isn’t exactly a walk in the park, especially if you’re figuring it out on your own.

That’s why I’ve been toying with the idea of putting together a simple, no-fluff guide on

what it

really

takes

to become a solid ML / AI Engineer in today’s industry

.

And then, the perfect opportunity popped up.

I connected with

Anas Riad

, a content creator on LinkedIn. He’s working as a

Data Analyst

right now but wants to make the jump into

ML Engineering

.

So we thought:

💡 Why not turn his

questions

into a

friendly back-and-forth

, like two people just chatting over drinks (and share it with the

community

)?

The AI Ladder

Now, here’s where I’d like to introduce you to a metaphor I typically use whenever people ask me how to break into the field:

the AI Ladder.

🪜 Instead of thinking of AI mastery as one big leap, imagine it as a ladder you climb.

Step by step. Each stage builds on the last, giving you a solid path forward.

Here are the 5 steps of the ladder I believe every aspiring ML / AI Engineer should climb:

Mathematical Foundations

- The bedrock that makes everything else click.

Hands-on Practice

- Frameworks, libraries, programming languages … actually putting theory into action.

Data Engineering

- A good data foundation is everything. Without it, even the best models will crumble.

ML / AI Engineering

- Learning the specifics about these two fields (ML pipelines, MLOps, LLMOps, finetuning, etc.)

Build, build, build

- Projects are the real proof of mastery, so keep building!

Step by step, up the AI ladder

Step 1 - Mathematical Foundations

Every strong ML engineer I’ve met has one thing in common:

a rock-solid foundation in mathematics.

Why? Because math isn’t just abstract theory here …

it’s the language of machine learning

.

Linear algebra powers neural networks, probability and statistics help models make sense of uncertainty, and calculus is what drives optimization.

Without these tools, you’ll constantly feel like you’re standing on shaky ground.

Now, here’s the good news: building this foundation doesn’t have to feel dry or overwhelming. It all comes down to

how you prefer to learn.

👉

If you’re a visual learner who loves videos

I cannot recommend

3Blue1Brown

enough.

His YouTube series makes tough math concepts click instantly. The visuals are intuitive, the pacing is spot on, and honestly, it’s one of the best free resources out there if you want math to finally

make sense.

It’s one of the sharpest publications I’ve seen for breaking down the mathematics behind machine learning in a way that’s both rigorous and accessible.

And if you’re serious about mastering the theory, Tivadar also has a book that I

highly

recommend diving into. It takes you beyond surface-level intuition and gives you the depth you need to really understand what’s happening under the hood.

Step 2 - Hands-on Practice

If you’d like a

full guide with a wider list of hands-on resources

, I’ve put one together specifically for that:

Read full story

Once you’ve got the math down, it’s time to roll up your sleeves and actually

build things.

There are countless resources out there for learning frameworks and programming, but since I don’t want this article turning into a library catalog 😅, I’ll stick to one recommendation that I think gives you the biggest bang for your time:

📘

Machine Learning with PyTorch and Scikit-Learn

by

Sebastian Raschka, PhD

Why this book?

Because it offers a detailed, hands-on walkthrough of the two most important frameworks for Machine Learning and Deep Learning (respectively):

Scikit-Learn

and

PyTorch

.

In my opinion, if you want to become a

top

ML Engineer, you absolutely need to feel at home with both of these libraries.

Step 3 - Data Engineering

Here’s the thing:

without good data, even the most brilliant models fall apart.

Data really is the fuel of machine learning, and knowing how to handle it properly is a skill every aspiring ML Engineer needs.

This step is all about learning how to:

Collect and process raw data

Clean and transform it into usable formats

Store it efficiently

And pipeline it into your models

If you don’t get this right, everything else suffers.

The good news?

## ✓ How we built our multi-agent research system \ Anthropic

**URL:** https://www.anthropic.com/engineering/multi-agent-research-system

Claude now has

Research capabilities

that allow it to search across the web, Google Workspace, and any integrations to accomplish complex tasks.

The journey of this multi-agent system from prototype to production taught us critical lessons about system architecture, tool design, and prompt engineering. A multi-agent system consists of multiple agents (LLMs autonomously using tools in a loop) working together. Our Research feature involves an agent that plans a research process based on user queries, and then uses tools to create parallel agents that search for information simultaneously. Systems with multiple agents introduce new challenges in agent coordination, evaluation, and reliability.

This post breaks down the principles that worked for us—we hope you'll find them useful to apply when building your own multi-agent systems.

Benefits of a multi-agent system

Research work involves open-ended problems where it’s very difficult to predict the required steps in advance. You can’t hardcode a fixed path for exploring complex topics, as the process is inherently dynamic and path-dependent. When people conduct research, they tend to continuously update their approach based on discoveries, following leads that emerge during investigation.

This unpredictability makes AI agents particularly well-suited for research tasks. Research demands the flexibility to pivot or explore tangential connections as the investigation unfolds. The model must operate autonomously for many turns, making decisions about which directions to pursue based on intermediate findings. A linear, one-shot pipeline cannot handle these tasks.

The essence of search is compression: distilling insights from a vast corpus. Subagents facilitate compression by operating in parallel with their own context windows, exploring different aspects of the question simultaneously before condensing the most important tokens for the lead research agent. Each subagent also provides separation of concerns—distinct tools, prompts, and exploration trajectories—which reduces path dependency and enables thorough, independent investigations.

Once intelligence reaches a threshold, multi-agent systems become a vital way to scale performance. For instance, although individual humans have become more intelligent in the last 100,000 years, human societies have become

exponentially

more capable in the information age because of our

collective

intelligence and ability to coordinate. Even generally-intelligent agents face limits when operating as individuals; groups of agents can accomplish far more.

Our internal evaluations show that multi-agent research systems excel especially for breadth-first queries that involve pursuing multiple independent directions simultaneously. We found that a multi-agent system with Claude Opus 4 as the lead agent and Claude Sonnet 4 subagents outperformed single-agent Claude Opus 4 by 90.2% on our internal research eval. For example, when asked to identify all the board members of the companies in the Information Technology S&P 500, the multi-agent system found the correct answers by decomposing this into tasks for subagents, while the single agent system failed to find the answer with slow, sequential searches.

Multi-agent systems work mainly because they help spend enough tokens to solve the problem. In our analysis, three factors explained 95% of the performance variance in the

BrowseComp

evaluation (which tests the ability of browsing agents to locate hard-to-find information). We found that token usage by itself explains 80% of the variance, with the number of tool calls and the model choice as the two other explanatory factors. This finding validates our architecture that distributes work across agents with separate context windows to add more capacity for parallel reasoning. The latest Claude models act as large efficiency multipliers on token use, as upgrading to Claude Sonnet 4 is a larger performance gain than doubling the token budget on Claude Sonnet 3.7. Multi-agent architectures effectively scale token usage for tasks that exceed the limits of single agents.

There is a downside: in practice, these architectures burn through tokens fast. In our data, agents typically use about 4× more tokens than chat interactions, and multi-agent systems use about 15× more tokens than chats. For economic viability, multi-agent systems require tasks where the value of the task is high enough to pay for the increased performance. Further, some domains that require all agents to share the same context or involve many dependencies between agents are not a good fit for multi-agent systems today. For instance, most coding tasks involve fewer truly parallelizable tasks than research, and LLM agents are not yet great at coordinating and delegating to other agents in real time. We’ve found that multi-agent systems excel at valuable tasks that involve heavy parallelization, information that exceeds single context windows, and interfacing w

How to become AI Engineer in 2026 ?

I have been working as a Java backend developer for about 8 years and mostly on typical enterprise projects. With all the demand for AI roles (AI Engineer, ML Engineer, Data Scientist, etc.), I don’t want to be stuck only in legacy Java while the industry shifts. My goal is to transition into AI/Data Science and be in an AI Engineer or Data Scientist role by the end of 2026. For someone with my background, what should a realistic roadmap look like in terms of Python, ML fundamentals, math (stats/linear algebra), and building projects/GitHub while working full time?

I am also deciding to follow a structured paid course online based in india. There are a lot of courses like Upgrad AI , LogicMojo AI & ML, ExcelR, Simplilearn, Great Learning, etc., and it’s hard to know was it worth it. If you have actually made this switch or seen others do it, how did you choose between these courses vs self learning ?

## ✓ The State of AI: Global Survey 2025 | McKinsey

The state of AI in 2025: Agents, innovation, and transformation

November 5, 2025

| Survey

Almost all survey respondents say their organizations are using AI, and many have begun to use AI agents. But most are still in the early stages of scaling AI and capturing enterprise-level value.

(30 pages)

Key findings

Most organizations are still in the experimentation or piloting phase:

Nearly two-thirds of respondents say their organizations have not yet begun scaling AI across the enterprise.

High curiosity in AI agents:

Sixty-two percent of survey respondents say their organizations are at least experimenting with AI agents.

Positive leading indicators on impact of AI:

Respondents report use-case-level cost and revenue benefits, and 64 percent say that AI is enabling their innovation. However, just 39Â percent report EBIT impact at the enterprise level.

High performers use AI to drive growth, innovation, and cost:

Eighty percent of respondents say their companies set efficiency as an objective of their AI initiatives, but the companies seeing the most value from AI often set growth or innovation as additional objectives.

Redesigning workflows is a key success factor:

Half of those AI high performers intend to use AI to transform their businesses, and most are redesigning workflows.

Differing perspectives on employment impact:

Respondents vary in their expectations of AIâs impact on the overall workforce size of their organizations in the coming year: 32Â percent expect decreases, 43 percent no change, and 13Â percent increases.

Three years since the introduction of genÂ AI tools

triggered a new era of artificial intelligence, nearly nine out of ten survey respondents say their organizations are regularly using AIâbut the pace of progress remains uneven. While AI tools are now commonplace, most organizations have not yet embedded them deeply enough into their workflows and processes to realize material enterprise-level benefits. The latest McKinsey Global Survey on the state of AI reveals a landscape defined by both wider useâincluding growing proliferation of agentic AIâand stubborn growing pains, with the transition from pilots to scaled impact remaining a work in progress at most organizations.

AI use continues to broaden but remains primarily in pilot phases

Our latest survey shows a larger share of respondents reporting AI use by their organizations, though most have yet to scale the technologies. The share of respondents saying their organizations are using AI in at least one business function has increased since our research last year: 88 percent report regular AI use in at least one business function, compared with 78 percent a year ago. But at the enterprise level, the majority are still in the experimenting or piloting stages (Exhibit 1), with approximately one-third reporting that their companies have begun to scale their AI programs.

Many organizations are already experimenting with AI agents

Organizations are also beginning to explore opportunities with AI agentsâsystems based on foundation models capable of acting in the real world, planning and executing multiple steps in a workflow. Twenty-three percent of respondents report their organizations are scaling an agentic AI system somewhere in their enterprises (that is, expanding the deployment and adoption of the technology within a least one business function), and an additional 39 percent say they have begun experimenting with AI agents. But use of agents is not yet widespread: Most of those who are scaling agents say theyâre only doing so in one or two functions. In any given business function, no more than 10 percent of respondents say their organizations are scaling AI agents (Exhibit 2).

Looking at individual business functions, agent use is most commonly reported in IT and knowledge management, where agentic use cases such as service-desk management in IT and deep research in knowledge management have quickly developed. By industry, the use of AI agents is most widely reported in the technology, media and telecommunications, and healthcare sectors (Exhibit 3).

For most organizations, AI use remains in pilot phases

Reported AI use ticks upward in nearly every industry

In every industry

besides the technology sector (which had already exceeded 90 percent reporting AI use), the share of respondents saying that their organization is regularly using AI in at least one business function has meaningfully increased since our previous survey. In last yearâs research, respondents working for technology companies reported being ahead of other industries with respect to their use of AI. Now, respondents in media and telecommunications and insurance are just as likely as those in tech

## ✓ AI Engineer Roadmap from Scratch to 2026 | Rabia Waqar Qazi posted on the topic | LinkedIn

You really don’t need a university degree to become an AI engineer in 2026.

Honestly, the biggest problem most people have isn’t intelligence or background…

It’s that they don’t know where to start.

Especially if you’ve already graduated.

Or you’re switching careers.

Or you’ve been wanting to get into AI but every roadmap online feels overwhelming.

So today, I put together something that I wish I had when I started.

A simple, clean, beginner-friendly roadmap, the exact path I’ve been following, that anyone can use to learn AI from scratch.

And the best part?

It’s completely free.

Because at the end of the day, you only need two things to break into AI:

▪️ Discipline

▪️ Determination

That’s it.

The resources exist. The opportunity exists.

You just need a path to follow.

So here’s the roadmap: from Python to ML, DL, GenAI, vector databases, embeddings, agents, deployment, cloud… all the way to becoming an AI engineer by 2026.

Need the PDF checklist version? Comment “Eon AI” and I’ll share it with you.

P.S. Hi! I’m Rabia 👋

I build end-to-end AI systems at Eon AI to help businesses scale faster and smarter.

If you want to explore how AI can help your business, send a DM or grab a FREE discovery call on my profile :)

Great reminder that breaking into AI today is less about formal credentials and more about having a clear, structured path and consistent effort. Which part of your roadmap do beginners usually find most challenging to tackle first?
