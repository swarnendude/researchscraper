“

Master AI before it masters you

.”

This is

Ruben Hassid

’s bio on LinkedIn.

That’s it.

No fancy title.

No sugar-coating.

No vanity badges.

His vision is crystal clear: to help creators use the power of AI to build a personal brand that works for them. And he is his own business proof:

He currently has

460K+ followers on LinkedIn

and is one of the top voices and

the go-to-creator for everything AI.

He’s been able to make his

posts

name go viral and become a household brand on social media.

But it wasn’t always the case…

2 years ago, Ruben was“no one” on social media. He published his first LinkedIn post in April 2022 and started writing and sharing about his 2 big passions:

Personal Brand

AI

He added consistency to the mix and his formula turned out to be the magic one. He went from being the underdog to an authority in the AI space.

His digital Masterclass “

How To Prompt Chat GPT in 2024

” is a Gumroad Bestseller with over 3,500 copies sold. There goes a 6-figure business with one single product. 🤯

In 2023, he published

EasyGen

, a software that helps creators generate LinkedIn Posts using the power of AI. In less than 2 years he has gained over 32,000 users and the reviews speak for themselves.

I invited Ruben to share his story with us and this is what we covered during our chat:

His creator journey starting from scratch

Finding his passion for technology, social media and AI

His personal brand: it’s not about being personal but useful!

Mastering LinkedIn: from zero to 450K+ followers in two years

Debate around AI for creators: how to use it the right way as a tool

Launching EasyGen: the AI software that is revolutionizing social media

## ✓ Meta's AI ad features: A game changer for advertisers | Jon Schulz posted on the topic | LinkedIn

**URL:** https://www.linkedin.com/posts/jon-schulz-4780ba4_meta-recently-announced-expanded-generative-activity-7382551739104858112-CQId?utm_source=chatgpt.com

Report this post

Meta recently announced expanded generative AI features to automate ad creative and targeting. Autonomous Advertising is coming, and fast. Sure, it might take bigger brands longer to adopt, but it’s coming for everyone. Across AI, what we thought would take a year is now taking six months. It just keeps getting better.

By early 2026, we’ll start seeing ad agents that fully handle both creative and media, just like Meta is hinting at. I might be biased, but I believe the players best positioned to win in this scenario aren’t the platforms like Meta, but the DSPs. Layering generative AI on top of existing pipes that already have the data, reach, and bidding infrastructure is infinitely more powerful than trying to teach an agent to visit Meta and other walled gardens to place ads.

But there’s actually an even bigger winner in all of this: ADVERTISERS!

When production costs collapse —and they will— creative possibilities explode. Historically, a brand with a small budget could afford maybe three spots a quarter. That meant if their ad didn’t fit the context, they were out of luck. If you were a drink company without a sports-themed creative, you probably weren’t showing up on ESPN during that campaign.

Now that same brand can spin up a sports-themed spot instantly. They can drop the publisher’s name into the creative or tweak the tone to match the content, and performance goes through the roof. We’ve already seen it in CTV through

IRIS.TV

data: match your ad’s emotional sentiment to the show’s content, and conversion rates jump two to four times versus baseline.

AI is enabling an exciting shift from one-size-fits-all creative to relevance on every impression.

Fear not: this is not the death of creative. This is creative, finally catching up to media.

## ✓ Social Network Usage & Growth Statistics (2026)

**URL:** https://backlinko.com/social-media-users?utm_source=chatgpt.com

Since its inception in 1996, social media has reached more than half of the world’s population.

Social network platforms’ total user base in the last decade grew from 970 million in 2010 to 5.41 billion users in July 2025.

The spectacular year-on-year adoption of new users on the platforms is, however, slowing down. It now relies on the continuous growth in the number of people with internet access and smartphones, particularly in developing regions.

So, how big is social media, and how has it evolved today?

Social Media Usage Statistics (Top Picks)

5.41 billion

people currently use social media worldwide – over double 2015’s 2.07 billion.

The average social media user engages with an average of

6.83

various social media platforms.

68.5%

of the global population uses social media.

The average person spends

2 hours 21 minutes

on social media per day.

Facebook is the leading social network with

3.07 billion

monthly active users.

73%

of the US population actively uses social media.

How Many People Use Social Media?

As of July 2025, over

5.41 billion

people use social media.

The average user accesses

6.83

social media platforms monthly.

All social networks report growth data on the number of monthly active users (MAUs) rather than the number of accounts, as this data is more accurate for measuring actual use and territory penetration.

What Percentage of People Use Social Media?

The current percentage of people using social media is

68.5%

of the world’s total population.

However, when we look into platform penetration rates from people in eligible audiences, that figure is approximately 95.58% of the 5.66 billion global internet users.

Key Statistics:

5.24 billion

people use social media worldwide, according to platform reports on the current number of active users.

86.6%

of the world’s population is active on social media when looking at eligible audiences aged 18+ years.

68.5%

of the global population uses social networks, regardless of age or internet access.

Out of 5.66 billion internet users,

95.58%

are active users.

How Many Social Platforms Does the Average Person Use?

According to the Global Web Index, global users aged 16+ access an average of

6.83 social media platforms

each month

.

That rises up to 7.71 platforms among audiences aged 16-24 years old.

A study of 53 countries shows that Japan averages the lowest number of social platforms used at 2.49. By comparison, the UAE has the highest with 8.62 per internet user.

5 Key Highlights:

Brazil

– 8.05 social media platforms per internet user

India

– 7.75 social media platforms per internet user

US

– 6.48 social media platforms per internet user

UK

– 6.14 social media platforms per internet user

Japan

– 3.49 social media platforms per internet user

How Many People Use Social Networks for Business?

38.3%

of all internet users worldwide use social media for work purposes.

In the US, only 25.4% of the population actively uses social media in their jobs.

Looking at the extremes, 65.2% of Nigerians use social media for work, while just 8.3% do so in Japan.

5 Key Highlights:

Brazil

– 50.2% of people use social media for work

India

– 41.2% of people use social media for work

USA

– 26.5% of people use social media for work

UK

– 25.4% of people use social media for work

Japan

– 8.3% of people use social media for work

Social Media Usage by Gender

The current global average gender split of social media users is

54.6%

men versus

45.4%

women.

Which gender uses social media more by region?

North America:

50% female vs. 50% male users

South America:

52% female vs. 48% male users

Western Europe:

50% female vs. 50% male users

Southern Africa:

49% female vs. 50% male users

Southern Asia:

34% female vs. 66% male users

South-Eastern Asia:

49% female vs. 51% male users

Oceania:

50% female vs. 50% male users

Which gender uses social media more by platform?

As you can see from the data above, social network usage is different for men and women globally when examining location. Perhaps the most notable gap in gender differences is when we look at the use by platform.

When looking at the top 8 social platforms, most index higher in male users. Pinterest dominates with female audiences.

## ✓ Meta Andromeda: Supercharging Advantage+ automation with the next-gen personalized ads retrieval engine - Engineering at Meta

Andromeda is Meta’s proprietary machine learning (ML) system design for retrieval in ad recommendation focused on delivering a step-function improvement in value to our advertisers and people.

This system pushes the boundary of cutting edge AI for retrieval with

NVIDIA Grace Hopper

Superchip and

Meta Training and Inference Accelerator (MTIA)

hardware through innovations in ML model architecture, feature representation, learning algorithm, indexing, and inference paradigm.

We’re sharing how Andromeda establishes an efficient scaling law for retrieval by harnessing the power of state-of-the-art deep neural networks, benefitting from the co-design of ML, system, and hardware (NVIDIA and MTIA chips) that improves performance and return on investment.

AI plays an important role in Meta’s advertising

system

by leveraging the power of machine learning (ML) to predict which ads a person will find most interesting. This helps people learn about a business or product they are interested in while helping an advertiser meet their objectives such as increasing brand awareness, acquiring new customers, and driving sales.

Retrieval is the first step in our multi-stage ads recommendation system. This stage is tasked with selecting ads from tens of millions of ad candidates into a few thousand relevant ad candidates. In the following stage, larger and more sophisticated ranking models predict people and advertiser value to determine the final set of ads to be shown to the person.

Challenges and opportunities in this new era of advertiser automation with generative AI

The retrieval stage is challenging primarily because of scalability constraints in two axes: volume of ad candidates and tight latency constraints.

Volume of ad candidates:

Retrieval processes three orders of magnitude more ads than subsequent stages. Features like predictive targeting, which dramatically improve advertiser outcomes, are computationally expensive. The continued positive momentum of Meta’s

Advantage+

suite further increases the number of eligible ads through

automation

of audience creation, optimal budget allocation, dynamic placement across Meta surfaces, and creative generation. Finally, with the adoption of powerful new tools based on generative AI

for creating and optimizing ad creative content, the number of ads creatives in Meta’s recommendation systems is expected to grow significantly.

Tight latency constraints:

Selecting ads rapidly is essential for delivering timely and relevant ads, as any delay can disrupt the viewers experience by not providing the most current content.

As advertising becomes increasingly dynamic, frequent updates to both delivery and each person’s interests demand increased model complexity in near real-time.

Processing such a vast number of ads in so little time is capacity intensive, which requires substantial optimization and innovation to scale up model complexity for better personalization while maintaining a high return on investment (ROI) on the required infrastructure investments.

Unlocking advertiser value through industry-leading ML innovation

Meta Andromeda is a personalized ads retrieval engine that leverages the NVIDIA Grace Hopper Superchip, to enable cutting edge ML innovation in the Ads retrieval stage to drive efficiency and advertiser performance. Key AI advancements include:

Deep neural networks custom-designed for the NVIDIA Grace Hopper Superchip to deliver superior performance

Andromeda improves performance of Meta ads system by delivering more personalized ads to viewers and maximizing return on ad spend for advertisers. Meta’s Ads team has created a deep neural network with increased compute complexity and massive parallelism on the NVIDIA Grace Hopper Superchip to better learn higher-order interactions from people and ads data. Its deployment across Instagram and Facebook applications has achieved +6% recall improvement to the retrieval system, delivering +8%

ads quality

improvement on selected segments.

Hierarchical indexing to support exponential ad creatives growth from Advantage+ creative

Advantage+ automates budget allocation, audience targeting, and bid adjustments – streamlining campaign management and boosting performance through more ads in the system for different audiences.

For example, when advertisers who did not previously use Advantage+ creative turned on its AI-driven targeting features, they experienced a 22% increase in ROAS from our ads. We estimate that businesses using image generation are seeing a +7% increase in conversions. Even at this early stage, more than a million advertisers used our generative AI (GenAI) tools to create more than 15 million ads in a month.

Andromeda is designed to maximize ads performance by utilizing the exponential growth in volume of eligible ads available to the retrieval

Twenty years ago, YouTube launched with the idea that everyone should have the opportunity to create and find a global stage. Since then, we’ve seen creators shape culture and entertainment in ways we never thought possible.

Anyone with an idea — whether an individual, artist, studio, or brand — can become a creator here. And we help them turn their idea into a business: we've paid out over $100 billion to creators, artists, and media companies globally over the last four years.

“We didn't just create a platform. We built an economy.”

- Neal Mohan, Chief Executive Officer, YouTube

Today at Made on YouTube, we’re introducing new products and innovations to power the next decade of creation, connection, and business, on YouTube.

Tell your story, your way

AI can help creative people everywhere share their stories, so we’re making creation on Shorts easier and more fun.

We’ve started integrating Google DeepMind’s Veo 3 Fast into YouTube Shorts so you can easily create video backgrounds or clips with sound, for free. And new capabilities powered by Veo allow you to apply motion, restyle videos, and add props to your scenes. Edit with AI will help turn your raw footage into a first draft video. Finally, Speech to song turns video dialogue into a funny soundtrack for your next Short. Learn more

.

“

We see AI as the next evolution of these tools – designed to empower human creativity and storytelling. But make no mistake – no studio, network, tech company, or AI tool will own the future of entertainment. That power belongs to you – the creators.

”

Neal Mohan

Chief Executive Officer, YouTube

Streamlining the creative process

Creators already use YouTube Studio for deeper insights and inspiration for what to create next. We’re now adding a new suite of tools designed to be a true creative partner across every phase of the creation journey.

Create Collaborations with other creators to expand your reach. Or gather insights from our new conversational tool, Ask Studio, to better optimize your channel. And get ready for A/B testing for titles, updates to the Inspiration Tab and upgrades to auto-dubbing.

Finally, we’re expanding our likeness detection tool, which allows creators to detect and manage videos made with AI using their facial likeness, coming soon to all YouTube Partner Program creators in an open beta.

Here’s a deeper dive into

Studio

.

Reinventing formats to build stronger connections

We’re bringing creators and their fans closer by reimagining TV and formats driving today’s culture.

Live content drives unparalleled interactivity and connection. On average, over 30% of daily logged-in YouTube viewers watched live content in Q2 2025 alone. Today, we’re making our largest upgrade to live ever by introducing new ways to connect with existing fans, reach new audiences, and better monetize live streams. Read all about our updates to live

here

.

The past few years have seen Podcasts’ cultural relevance transform through video; we're bringing new tools to help podcast creators reach and connect with their audiences more deeply. These features will help podcasters easily create engaging video clips and Shorts from full episodes. Don’t have the time or resources for video? Google DeepMind’s Veo can help generate a customizable video from audio files.

Fostering connections between artists and their fans

Fandom

moves music culture and powers artists careers, so we’re creating new opportunities to connect artists with their fans.

On YouTube Music, you’ll see the option to countdown to upcoming new releases and pre-save your favorites. And across YouTube, we’re building tools that let artists reward and connect with their top fans through exclusive merch, “thank you” videos, behind-the-scenes clips, and other just-for-fans content.

.

Building brand to creator relationships

We’re adding updates to brand deals and Shopping to make brand collaborations easier than ever. We're accelerating these deals through a new initiative and new product features to make sure those partnerships succeed - like the ability to add a link to a brand's site in Shorts. And YouTube Shopping is expanding to more markets and merchants and getting help from AI to make tagging easier. Learn more about these updates

Break down language barriers with auto dubbing on YouTube

The YouTube Team

[[read-time]] minute read

It’s now easier than ever to connect with creators and content from all over the world even if you don't speak the language, thanks to YouTube’s new auto dubbing feature. Whether you want to learn to cook

authentic gratin from a French chef

, sew

traditional clothes from an Indian seamstress

, or

scout spooky spots to visit in another country

, auto dubbing makes that content more accessible.

We've just made auto dubbing available to hundreds of thousands of channels in the YouTube Partner Program that are focused on knowledge and information and will expand to other types of content soon.

Here’s how it works.

1. Upload your video

Just like you normally would! No need to do anything special. YouTube will automatically detect the language of your video and create dubbed versions in other languages.

2. Watch your dubbed videos

If you want to see your dubbed videos, you can find them in YouTube Studio in the "Languages" section. Listen to the dubs and see if you're happy with them. If not, no worries! You can unpublish or even delete any dubs you don't like.

3. Not sure if you have it? Head over to YouTube Studio

This is your control center for all things YouTube. If it’s available for your channel, you’ll find it under

"Advanced Settings"

. You can always choose to review the dubs before publishing.

Now, it's important to remember that this technology is still pretty new, and it won't always be perfect. We're working hard to make it as accurate as possible, but there might be times when the translation isn't quite right or the dubbed voice doesn’t accurately represent the original speaker. We really

appreciate your patience and feedback

as we continue to improve!

Here are some of the languages you can use with auto dubbing

If your video is in English,

it will be dubbed into French, German, Hindi, Indonesian, Italian, Japanese, Portuguese, and Spanish.

If your video is in any of those other languages,

it will be dubbed into English.

Viewers can look out for the “auto-dubbed” label to distinguish when a video has auto-dubbed audio tracks, or use

the track selector

to hear the video in its original language. We’ll remember their language of choice for future videos too.

Hype: Giving fans a stake in their favorite creators

What’s next?

We continue to work with our colleagues in Google DeepMind and Google Translate to bring cutting edge capabilities to make dubs even more accurate, expressive, and natural. Look forward to updates that will bring

“Expressive Speech,” previewed at Made on YouTube

, to help emulate the creator’s tone, emotion, and even the ambiance of the surroundings.

Look out for auto dubbing in your next video!

Social Media Ad Spending

Worldwide

The news:

Meta unveiled 11 new AI advertising features at Cannes Lions 2025 and confirmed a $14 to $15 billion

investment in Scale AI

for a 49% stake, signaling its ambition to become a foundational player in global AI infrastructure.

Meta’s AI-powered Advantage+ ad suite now includes features like brand-consistent automation (logos, fonts, color palettes), dynamic image-to-video generation, AI-generated product highlights, and voice-activated responses.

Meta rolled out a new image-to-video tool on Facebook and Instagram that stitches together up to 20 product photos into polished, multi-scene clips, enabling small and midsize advertisers to produce high-quality video without external editing help.

These tools help marketers quickly transform static assets into animated video ads, complete with music, overlays, and text—no production team required.

Meta says Advantage+ Sales Campaigns deliver an average 22% boost in return on ad spend (ROAS), while Meta GEM, its generative recommendation model, improves conversions by up to 5%.

Zooming out:

This adds to Meta’s growing suite of automated tools, including

a text-to-image generator

launched in May 2024 and

an image-to-GIF tool

which debuted last October.

Shifting the narrative:

After CEO Mark Zuckerberg drew criticism for suggesting AI could eventually eliminate the need for creative, targeting, and measurement, Meta leaders have taken a more nuanced tone, emphasizing partnership rather than replacement

The next era of 'influencer' in an AI-first world

The influencer era isn’t over. It’s transitioning.

Social media platforms have always grown and changed. Despite their current, intricate (often compulsive, mostly overwhelming) role in our daily lives – where every minute surrendered can feel like pulling a lever in a casino with no winning ticket – the story of technology is one of constant evolution. These specific platforms, like those before them, will eventually wane. The rise of sophisticated AI agents promises to accelerate this transition.

In a world rapidly taking shape, each of us could have our own AI agents acting as both curators and filters for our informational lives. You can imagine your AI agent sorting through the incessant noise, becoming a source for insights and recommendations tailored precisely to you. It bypasses the need to follow hundreds or thousands of disparate human voices; instead, it synthesizes vast streams of information, presenting options and perspectives aligned with your interests, values, and cognitive style. Influence itself shifts: from a broadcast model (one-to-many) dominating the social media era, towards a model of personal synthesis (AI-to-one).

For now, let’s park the issues pertaining to an “AI-filtered world.” But I assure you, there are several. Not least of which include biased world views shaped by the AI models, echo chambers, and more. Stay tuned for part 2.

Influence isn’t disappearing; it's transitioning

While the notion that “the influencer era is over” is gaining traction, I think it misses the nuance. Influence isn’t disappearing; it's transitioning. In an AI-mediated world, the signal from a trusted human potentially becomes more valuable as it passes through more rigorous filters. Crucially,

who

constitutes an influential human shifts dramatically. Influence becomes less about mass appeal or follower counts cultivated through algorithmic luck, and more on demonstrable alignment with the specific values, interests, and trust criteria defined by the individual user and their agent. The paradigm shifts away from sheer visibility towards perceived, verifiable value.

This deeper seeking is already evident in the growing preference for thoughtful niche creators over generic noise. The rise of Substack and newsletters, the rapid growth of podcasts—we are taking more control over where we place our attention. A trend AI agents could accelerate by allowing users to more directly guide their agents towards sources offering the substance and resonance they seek – driven by admiration, the desire to learn, or shared interests.

Consider my personal media diet focused on economics, emerging technologies, and geopolitics. My AI agent could identify the analyses that resonate most, are intellectually stimulating according to my known preferences, and meet my criteria for rigor. Efficiently delivering depth over breadth.

But this vision prompts a crucial question:

if algorithms and agents filter everything, will people still be motivated to create and share their work?

Why pour effort into analysis or artistry if it might simply be summarized, repackaged, or even ignored by an opaque AI filter?

The incentive structure for creators and contributors, however, doesn't vanish; it shifts. While intrinsic motivations like passion and intellectual curiosity persist, the goal evolves beyond chasing unpredictable virality. Contributors will be incentivized to craft high-quality, reliable signals intended for receptive, relevant audiences identified by intelligent filters – moving from shouting in a stadium to engaging in focused dialogue. In today’s social media world enragement often equals engagement. The loudest and most polarizing voices dominate our feeds, particularly in the

political sphere, even though studies consistently show that most people hold views closer to the center. In the future, however, users could  instruct their AI agents to seek out nuanced political content representing more balanced perspectives

.

The amplification of the fringes that social media currently prioritizes could therefore diminish. The validation sought is recognition for consistently providing rigorous analysis, prescient insights, or resonant creative work.

The new metrics defining success

The metrics defining success must evolve beyond likes and follower counts. Instead, we can anticipate the rise of new benchmarks implicitly tracked and valued within this ecosystem, such as relevance scores indicating how often an agent surfaces the work for specific user needs, trustworthiness ratings derived from AI analysis of source history and methodology, and measures of engagement depth within the creator's community. Further indicators might include the frequency of integration or citation in other high-quality analyses facilitated by AI, alongside positive validation from recognized peers and experts – all sign

Artificial intelligence (AI) is redefining the world of work, especially how we work, and it's top-of-mind for everyone from employers and job seekers to marketers and sellers. According to our

Global Talent Trends report

, released today, job posts mentioning AI or Generative AI (GAI) have more than doubled (2.2x) globally in the last two years and applications for these posts have grown 17% faster compared to those that don't mention AI or GAI.

As our CEO Ryan Roslansky shared today at our 12th annual

Talent Connect Summit

, one exciting possibility of AI is its ability to take on some of workers’ day-to-day drudgery, freeing extra time for the more people-centric, strategic aspects of their job. To help our customers unlock greater productivity and prioritize the most impactful work, we announced new AI-powered tools across our recruiting and marketing products today:

Tested 5 AI content creation tools and honestly most disappointed me

Spent the last two months trying jasper, copy.ai, hootsuite's ai features, later, and blotato because I was tired of spending entire days on social content.

Jasper writes well but it's pricey and you still need to edit everything heavily. Copy.ai has good templates but the output feels samey after a while. Hootsuite's ai stuff is honestly pretty basic, feels tacked on. Later has beautiful templates but if you need video or apis you're out of luck.

Ended up with blotato mostly because it doesn't try to do the writing for you, just handles the reformatting and distribution. Still has some quirks but the video support and api access made sense for what I needed.

Anyone else go through this testing phase? Feels like every tool promises the world and delivers like 60% of it.
