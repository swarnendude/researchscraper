## ✓ Salesforce Releases AI Fluency Playbook for Agentic Enterprises - Salesforce

**URL:** https://www.salesforce.com/news/stories/ai-fluency-playbook-for-agentic-enterprise/

Today, Salesforce published its

AI Fluency Playbook

, a practical guide for businesses to prepare their workforce to confidently collaborate with AI to give employees agency and drive business impact at speed and scale.

Why it matters:

As companies look to become an

Agentic Enterprise

, success will depend on their workforce’s ability to harness and apply agentic AI in their daily work. Businesses that build AI fluent workforces will drive greater growth and position themselves to attract top talent and become a best place to work. And it’s not just businesses that benefit — employees who use AI daily report

64% higher productivity

,

58% better focus

, and

81% greater job satisfaction

.

Go deeper:

The AI Fluency Playbook is built from Salesforce’s own experience deploying

AI agents

as

Customer Zero

for Agentforce

. Today, Salesforce employees are collaborating with agents, and 85% say they feel confident using AI tools to drive productivity in their daily work — a 16% increase year over year. The results are clear: In just one year,

Agentforce in Slack

saved employees over 500,000 hours, Engagement Agent worked over 190,000 leads with the sales team, and Service Agent handled over 2 million support requests for the customer service team.

Today is all about learning agility — human skills like learning, adaptability, communication, and critical thinking are so important for the era of agentic AI.

Ali Bebo, Chief Human Resources Officer at Pearson

Agents are unlocking possibilities for every worker by automating mundane tasks and augmenting employee potential. But to truly enhance daily work and drive better business outcomes, employees need the knowledge, skills, and tools to collaborate successfully with AI agents. Organizations can build this AI fluency in three ways:

AI Engagement:

Enhance employee sentiment and confidence around AI.

AI Activation:

Drive consistent adoption in employees’ daily work.

AI Expertise:

Build proficiency of human, agentic, and business skills that drive successful human + agent adoption.

## ✓ The Critical Role of AI Literacy Across the Enterprise | Grammarly Business

**URL:** https://www.grammarly.com/business/learn/role-of-generative-ai-literacy/?utm_source=chatgpt.com

Artificial intelligence (AI) has the potential to drastically transform nearly every area of your business. This isn’t news. Soon, the integration of AI will no longer be an option for businesses but a necessity. Some might find this daunting. But innovative companies and professionals have already been using AI to reshape work.

AI stands out for its ability

to transform business communication by automating and enhancing manual and time-consuming communication tasks.

AI can help companies

accelerate high-quality content production, gain new insights, scale personalized customer outreach, and enhance overall communication quality. AI isn’t just a technological upgrade. It’s a fundamental shift in how employees communicate and how businesses operate. It’s the new language of business.

The benefits of being fluent in this language are significant.

Knowledge workers using AI say

it increases their productivity, reduces stress, and lightens their workload. Leaders tout similar benefits for their business, including saved costs, faster pace of innovation, and increased quality of service.

However, your organization will only realize the benefits of AI if all of your employees are equipped to use the technology. Until everyone is empowered to “speak the same language” of AI, you’ll only see limited success—and right now, the majority (

78%

) of workers say they want to learn how to use AI more effectively for their jobs.

Read on to learn the fundamentals of AI literacy across the enterprise and its importance in transforming your business.

Understanding AI literacy gaps across the enterprise

Before we dive in, it’s important to start with the fundamentals. The (near) future workplace will be one in which every employee’s unique skill set will be augmented by artificial intelligence. While some may fear or resist this new technology, the reality is that machines will not replace knowledge workers—instead, they will enhance, automate, and make our lives easier. But this is possible only if every employee can proficiently use AI tools to capture their full potential.

Every employee at your company is likely in a different phase of AI literacy. If your company aims to continue on its path of AI adoption, it’s critical to start by ensuring your workforce has an equitable AI skillset. Here are four key AI literacy definitions that describe where someone may be in their relationship with AI at work:

AI avoidant:

They choose not to interact with AI tools at work.

AI familiar:

They experiment with AI at work.

AI literate:

They use AI comfortably in their daily work.

AI fluent:

They are using AI in advanced ways that many others are not; also referred to as “power users.”

According to Grammarly’s annual report,

The Productivity Shift: From Overwhelm to AI Empowerment

, 39% of knowledge workers report using AI at work regularly. Of this group, only 13% identify themselves as AI fluent while 26% are AI literate. The largest cohort (39%) consider themselves AI familiar, meaning that they have experimented with AI but are not yet using it as a part of their daily work, while 22% still avoid AI altogether.

Regular AI usage is more common among business leaders, with 33% falling into the literate category and 30% considered fluent. Only a small percentage (9%) of leaders are avoiding AI technology completely.

Businesses must not only address AI literacy, but also close the AI literacy and fluency gaps that exist between levels, teams, and generations.

It’s clear that AI experimentation is rampant in the workplace, particularly among younger workers. Notably, Gen Z and millennial generations have embraced AI, with over 80% having at least experimented with AI tools at work. The older generations are far more likely to resist the new technology, with 23% of Gen Xers and a staggering 46% of baby boomers avoiding it altogether.

This rampant experimentation amplifies the urgency and need for AI literacy across the enterprise. If your employees are familiar with AI tools but not using them safely or effectively, it increases the risk for your business. That’s why it is key to invest in proper training and develop formal policies to up-level the skillset of your entire workforce.

Perhaps the most noteworthy AI usage and literacy gaps exist between different teams within an organization. Knowledge workers in sales and customer experience (CX) have been more resistant to adopting AI in their roles. Meanwhile, their colleagues in IT and marketing are mostly literate with AI tools. These gaps must be addressed in order for businesses to reap the benefits of AI enterprise-wide.

If the usage and literacy gaps go unaddressed, it can lead to inconsistencies in how your business processes are handled and can create bottlenecks in which AI-utilizing departments must wait for others to catch up. For instance, if only the IT department uses AI regularly while other departments such as sales and CX do not, your organiz

Web Scraping for AI Training: A Beginner’s Guide to Building Quality Datasets

Introduction

Artificial Intelligence as a solution has seen a significant rise over the past few years. The popularity of AI models has shifted from being a tool to being a necessity for every business’s successful running. That being said, these AI models are only powerful depending on the quality of the data that they learn from.

The most interesting aspect of AI models is that behind every advanced AI model lies a massive dataset that has been meticulously prepared and structured. So, whether it is predicting consumer behaviour or even understanding human language, AI models have a clear dependence on reliable and quality datasets. However, one question that very commonly arises is, where does this data come from? The answer is that some industries and businesses generally extract these massive datasets internally with a dedicated team. But, as the competition in the industry is rising day by day, the need for data is rising phenomenally. That being said, this rising need, in turn, also increases the need for massive datasets.

Now, extracting such a large volume of datasets can be very time-consuming and manually tiring. Moreover, they can also be prone to errors since there is complete manual intervention throughout the data collection process. And this is exactly where web scraping has started gaining quite a lot of popularity over the years.

This is because web scraping empowers businesses to

extract large volumes of data automatically

. Moreover, web scraping smartly eliminates the need for any kind of manual intervention, which, in turn, eliminates errors in the data. The best part is that it reduces operational costs and saves time due to its accurate automation. Plus, with the help of web scraping, businesses and individuals can train their AI models on quality datasets. They can easily tap into the enormous space of publicly available data online and train their AI models with quality data that is required. And for AI training, this would mean curating diverse and relevant datasets that help algorithms identify patterns while also making intelligent decisions.

To give you a deeper understanding of how important quality datasets are for AI training, in this blog, we take you through some of the key aspects.

The Role of Web Scraping in AI Training

Web scraping undoubtedly plays a significant role in the training of AI models. It is indeed a fact that AI models require structured data to learn and identify different patterns. However, most of the data that is extracted manually is usually in unstructured and inconsistent formats. This is where web scraping helps! It bridges the gap by carefully extracting and organizing data into machine-readable formats.

To give you a deeper understanding, here is a quick example. Consider that you are building a natural language processing model that has been carefully designed to understand customer reviews. Now, web scraping will empower you to feed the AI model with a large volume of data by scraping thousands of reviews online, and also help feed the model with a range of contextual examples. If you are building an image recognition AI model, the algorithm of the model will benefit from a large volume of scraped images across industries and businesses. That being said, web scraping empowers you with this large volume of data automatically and helps get the data with the utmost reliability.

Beyond simply enabling businesses to get their hands on a large volume of data, web scraping always ensures diversity of the data. Now, if the AI model is trained on narrow datasets, then it can be prone to biases. This is why pulling information from different sources on the internet is very important, and this is where web scraping can contribute to building more accurate AI systems.

The Quality of Data for AI Training

It is indeed certain that the successful operation of any AI model lies at the core of the quality of the data on which it has been trained. Moreover, even AI models that are built on highly sophisticated models can fail to deliver accurate and reliable results if the datasets that they have been trained on are of poor quality. Plus, it also increases the likelihood of erroneous predictions, which can further directly impact the decision-making processes of businesses. This is why it becomes very important to train AI models on high-quality and reliable data.

Here, at 3i Data Scraping, we adopt a rigorous and process-driven approach throughout the data extraction process. Through our professional web data scraping services, we offer solutions that extend far beyond simple data extraction. As experts in the industry, we incorporate advanced processing techniques that ensure the quality of data by removing all duplicate data and standardizing the formats. This disciplined

About this Document

Framework for AI Fluency (Practical Summary Document), Version 1.1

The Framework for AI Fluency summarized in this document has emerged from an ongoing research collaboration between Prof. Rick Dakan from the

Ringling College of Art and Design, Florida

, and Prof. Joseph Feller from the

Cork University Business School

, University College Cork, Ireland. Dakan and Feller’s work explores the intersection between (1) Human Creativity and Innovation, (2) Generative AI technologies (GenAI), and (3) Learning & Teaching in Higher Education.

The Framework for AI Fluency summarized in this document has emerged from an ongoing research collaboration (Prof Rick Dakan from the Ringling College of Art and Design, Florida, and Prof Joseph Feller from the Cork University Business School, University College Cork, Ireland) exploring the intersections between AI, creativity, innovation and learning.

The framework has also been (and continues to be) informed by the ongoing design and delivery of student courses, as well as faculty seminars and workshops, at both the Ringling College of Art and Design and the Cork University Business School, in the 2023/2024, 2024/2025, and 2025/2026 Academic Years.

This document presents a overview of the framework as a practical tool that is designed to inform discourse and practice in higher education on curriculum and assessment design, academic policy setting, student employability and career coaching, and similar topics in the context of AI (and particularly GenAI) digital disruption.

Although primarily aimed at higher education, we imagine that the framework in this form will also benefit other educational levels, and indeed organizations more widely addressing the challenges and opportunities of GenAI.

Framework Overview

The Framework for AI Fluency describes the interconnected competencies needed to use AI in creative, innovative, and problem solving work. Rather than viewing AI merely as an efficiency engine, the framework recognizes the potential for AI to act as an authentic thinking partner for doing meaningful cognitive work, while acknowledging that this potential can only be realized through the development and performance of specific human competencies.

We define AI Fluency as the ability to work effectively, efficiently, ethically, and safely within emerging modalities of Human-AI interaction. In its current version, the framework identifies three modalities of interaction observable in the current state-of-the-art:

Modality 1: Automation (AI Performs Human-Defined Task)

AI performs tasks independently, but based on direct human instructions (e.g. in response to a prompt).

This modality is particularly useful for improving the efficiency of repetitive, time-consuming, or data-intensive tasks.

Requires clear task definition and quality control measures.

Examples: Emails, summaries, social media posts, basic coding.

Modality 2: Augmentation (AI and Human Perform Task Collaboratively)

AI and human co-define and co-execute tasks in an iterative way, collaborating towards an end goal

This modality focuses on enhancing human creativity rather than replacing it through the addition of an AI thinking partner.

Involves a dynamic interplay between human and AI contribution.

Examples: Writing stories, essays, research papers, complex coding tasks.

Modality 3: Agency (Human Configures AI to Perform Tasks Independently)

Human configures AI to independently perform future tasks (including for others) on behalf of the user.

This modality defines the characteristics and future behavior of an AI, rather than a specific task.

Requires sophisticated understanding of AI capabilities and limitations.

Examples: Interactive game characters, tutors, chatbots.

Human-AI interactions often bridge multiple modalities, and practitioners often move between contexts even within single projects or workflows.

from

Absorb Software

, today released its

Enterprise L&D in 2026: Trends and Predictions report

, highlighting a seismic shift in the workplace driven by rapid advances in AI and automation. Based on responses from global HR and L&D leaders, the report reveals that while 61% of organizations have adopted or are testing AI in their L&D strategies, only 11% feel extremely confident in their future skills-building strategy—exposing a significant readiness gap.

The findings show that even as AI accelerates productivity and reshapes roles, its impact still depends on people—the capabilities they build, the adaptability they demonstrate, the leadership that guides them, and the human-centered learning experiences, such as mentoring, that enable performance. This confidence gap poses challenges for teams under increasing pressure to demonstrate workforce readiness, while also presenting untapped opportunities to transform technology investments into meaningful capability development.

“AI is transforming work at an unprecedented pace, and this year’s findings reinforce that people determine whether that transformation succeeds,” said Kimberly Williams, Chief Executive Officer of Absorb Software. “Today, organizations need employees who can think critically, lead confidently, and learn continuously. Mentorship strengthens these capabilities by giving people the support they need to adapt and perform in an AI-enabled workplace.”

The study takes a deep dive into 2026’s top L&D priorities, emerging skill gaps, AI readiness challenges, and the rising urgency of people-centric learning as the bridge between technological adoption and workforce capability.

Key Findings: Requirements for AI-Enabled Success

Skills training must accelerate:

Strategic and critical thinking (56%), digital fluency (44%), and leadership skills (42%)

remain the most critical capabilities for 2026, reflecting the shift toward AI-enabled roles. Yet only 11% of HR and L&D leaders feel extremely confident in their future skills-building strategy, indicating that capability development is not keeping pace with technological adoption. The report also highlights rising demand for adaptability, resilience, and emotional intelligence—human skills employees will need to interpret

AI insights

, navigate uncertainty, and collaborate effectively.

Leadership development remains the top priority: Leadership development is the #1 L&D priority for 2026 at 27%, followed by reskilling and upskilling (24%).

Significant gaps persist: only 47% of employees strongly agree they know what’s expected of them, 31% feel encouraged in their development, 32% feel connected to their organization’s mission, and just 28% feel their opinions count (Gallup data). These findings reinforce the report’s call for performance enablement—supportive, ongoing, people-first leadership to guide teams through change.

Organizational knowledge becomes more critical:

As AI automates routine tasks,

institutional knowledge—the “how” and “why” behind decisions—becomes increasingly valuable.

Yet, 43.6% of organizations do not use any social learning programs

, and nearly a quarter of those who do say their programs are ineffective (as mentioned in the Absorb 2025 State of Upskilling

report

). Combined with low clarity on expectations, this signals that knowledge transfer remains one of the most underused levers during a period when context-rich, experience-based learning is most essential.

Technology must evolve to support people-first development: Modernizing learning technology is the third-highest L&D priority (18%), but readiness gaps persist. 36%

of organizations have not yet integrated AI into their L&D programs or have no plans to integrate it, and only

22% of employees say their organization has shared a clear AI plan, and time pressures further limit readiness—41% of employees lack time to learn, and 37% of managers lack time

to support development (Gallup data). The report underscores that modernization requires more than new tools—it depends on AI literacy, accessible data, cultural alignment, and learning that fits seamlessly into daily work.

Mentorship Emerges as the Critical “Human-in-the-Loop”

A common barrier emerges across all findings: organizations are struggling to translate skill needs, leadership expectations, and institutional knowledge into day-to-day capability—and this is where human support is essential. The report identifies

mentorship as the mechanism that simultaneously strengthens skills, leadership, and organizational knowledge, with 77% of HR and L&D leaders saying formal mentorship will be critical for employee development in 2026.

Mentorship provides what AI cannot: context-rich knowledge transfer that turns training into performance, coaching that sharpens decision-making and change navigation,

2025 Chief Learning & Talent Officers Priorities & Predictions

The i4cp Team, i4cp

|

January 6, 2025

January 6, 2025

Members of

i4cp’s Chief Learning & Talent Officer Board

predict that 2025 will:

Be a year with heightened expectations of the learning and talent function to deliver business value despite limited technology and other resources.

See CLOs and CTOs seek more collaboration across HR and other functions to promote and reinforce cultures that enable and reward continuous learning.

Have CLOs and CTOs laser-focused on building future-ready capability among managers and the workforce.

In addition, clearly there is much work to be done regarding AI—over half (56%) of learning and talent leaders surveyed indicated that they believe their organizations are only “somewhat prepared” for an AI-enabled future of work; 21% indicated their organizations are prepared, and an equal number said their organizations are “not prepared”—and no one said their organization is “very prepared.” And just over half (51%) of responding CLTO Board members indicated that they view the available talent pool as a top-three external issue of concern—they see it as posing a potential threat to their organization’s ability to execute on their 2025 strategies.

Priorities

Increasing manager effectiveness in the face of complex and increasing demands

— leadership development remains a perennial concern for the learning and talent leaders, but a three-year trend to prioritize manager effectiveness in the face of complex and increasing demands has risen to the top. There are several factors driving this, including the nature of work shifting to more distributed and more team-based, as well as the need for managers to focus on more than performance and productivity, such as culture, employee well-being, and more.

Upskilling the organization’s workforce

—in addition to building manager capabilities, 46% of chief learning and/or talent officers indicated they have prioritized the broad upskilling or reskilling of the organization’s workforce. This was already a trend, but the growth of AI has made it a critical need: nearly four of five survey participants (79%) said their organization’s workforce is unprepared or at best somewhat prepared to use generative AI in their work. The same study provided a major reason: only 18% of organizations offer generative AI training to most or all of their employees as of September 2024 (i4cp, 2025).

Building or maintaining a healthy organizational culture

—

culture renovation

remains a top concern for learning leaders, and this priority is no small effort. For many CLOs and CTOs, this will result in greater emphasis on building and rewarding the how of leadership (i.e., how a leader works with their teams and across the enterprise to deliver the desired outcomes). In many organizations, what it means to be a good leader is being redefined, along with updated measurements and incentives around leader behaviors that deliver desired business and employee outcomes.

Leveraging AI to enhance learning and/or talent programs

—the adoption of AI (including generative AI) is nearly unanimously viewed as important to CLTO Board members in the context of its role in the ability to deliver on their objectives in 2025. While only 16% considered it “very important,” over a third (34%) said it was “important,” 41% said it was “somewhat important.”

Establishing or improving the organization’s learning culture

—continuous learning has long been a high-performance organization differentiator and is now a competitive necessity given the speed and frequency of technological change and the value workers across all generations place on their personal development.

i4cp research

has found that those who describe their organizations' cultures as healthy are

7x

more likely to say they have learning centered cultures than those who describe their organizations' cultures as toxic  (i4cp, 2023b). Also, traits of a learning culture according to our previous research include:

Active knowledge sharing permeates the organization

Learning is an espoused organizational value

Leaders (at all levels) are teaching

Learning is reinforced in hiring and development

Measuring learning’s effectiveness

Managers rewarded for mobility and development

“  AI presents a major strategic opportunity for learning teams to showcase their agility, helping the organization adopt a transformative technology that will reshape the wa

## ✓ AI in the workplace: A report for 2025 | McKinsey

Superagency in the workplace: Empowering people to unlock AI’s full potential

January 28, 2025

| Report

Roger Roberts

Almost all companies invest in AI, but just 1 percent believe they are at maturity. Our research finds the biggest barrier to scaling is not employees—who are ready—but leaders, who are not steering fast enough.

Superagency in the workplace: Empowering people to unlock AIâs full potential

(47 pages)

Artificial intelligence has arrived in the workplace

and has the potential to be as transformative as the steam engine was to the 19th-century Industrial Revolution.

1

â

Gen AI: A cognitive industrial revolution

,â McKinsey, June 7, 2024.

With powerful and capable large language models (LLMs) developed by Anthropic, Cohere, Google, Meta, Mistral, OpenAI, and others, we have entered a new information technology era. McKinsey research sizes the long-term AI opportunity at $4.4 trillion in added productivity growth potential from corporate use cases.

2

â

The economic potential of generative AI: The next productivity frontier

,â McKinsey, June 14, 2023.

Therein lies the challenge: the long-term potential of AI is great, but the short-term returns are unclear. Over the next three years, 92 percent of companies plan to increase their AI investments. But while nearly all companies are investing in AI, only 1 percent of leaders call their companies âmatureâ on the deployment spectrum, meaning that AI is fully integrated into workflows and drives substantial business outcomes. The big question is how business leaders can deploy capital and steer their organizations closer to AI maturity.

This research report, prompted by Reid Hoffmanâs book

Superagency: What Could Possibly Go Right with Our AI Future

,

3

Reid Hoffman and Greg Beato,

Superagency: What Could Possibly Go Right with Our AI Future

, Authors Equity, January 2025.

asks a similar question: How can companies harness AI to amplify human agency and unlock new levels of creativity and productivity in the workplace? AI could drive enormous positive and disruptive change. This transformation will take some time, but leaders must not be dissuaded. Instead, they must advance boldly today to avoid becoming uncompetitive tomorrow. The history of major economic and technological shifts shows that such moments can define the rise and fall of companies. Over 40 years ago, the internet was born. Since then, companies including Alphabet, Amazon, Apple, Meta, and Microsoft have attained trillion-dollar market capitalizations. Even more profoundly, the internet changed the anatomy of work and access to information. AI now is like the internet many years ago: The risk for business leaders is not thinking too big, but rather too small.

This report explores companiesâ technology and business readiness for AI adoption (see sidebar âAbout the surveyâ). It concludes that employees are ready for AI. The biggest barrier to success is leadership.

About the survey

To create our report,

we surveyed 3,613 employees (managers and independent contributors) and 238 C-level executives in October and November 2024. Of these, 81 percent came from the United States, and the rest came from five other countries: Australia, India, New Zealand, Singapore, and the United Kingdom. The employees spanned many roles, including business development, finance, marketing, product management, sales, and technology.

All the survey findings discussed in the report, aside from two sidebars presenting international nuances, pertain solely to US workplaces. The findings are organized in this way because the responses from US employees and C-suite executives provide statistically significant conclusions about the US workplace. Analyzing global findings separately allows a comparison of differences between US responses and those from other regions.

Chapter 1

looks at the rapid advancement of technology over the past two years and its implications for business adoption of AI.

Chapter 2

delves into the attitudes and perceptions of employees and leaders. Our research shows that employees are more ready for AI than their leaders imagine. In fact, they are already using AI on a regular basis; are three times more likely than leaders realize to believe that AI will replace 30 percent of their work in the next year; and are eager to gain AI skills. Still, AI optimists are only a slight majority in the workplace; a large minority (41 percent) are more apprehensive and will need additional support. This is where millennials, who are the most familiar with AI and are often in managerial roles, can be strong advocates for change.

Chapter 3

looks at the need for speed and safety in AI deployment. While leaders and employees want to move faster, trust and safety are top concerns. About half of employees worry about AI inaccuracy and cybersecurity risks. That said, employees express greater confidence that th

My CEO thinks AI can replace our entire marketing team. Am I insane or is he?

I’m the head of marketing in a B2C company that supports around 60 physical retail locations and runs frequent onsite activations and events.

Our marketing team is extremely lean. Two marketers including me, plus two in-house graphic designers and two extra partners, only running weekly community events on field.

Everything is handled internally. Strategy, daily social media content including TikTok, event planning and onsite activations, website management, overall marketing strategy, performance, coordination with roughly 60 stores, and even light legal work like terms and conditions for promotions. There are no agencies or external partners involved.

My fellow marketer is leaving in a month to pursue a master’s degree. I recently learned that my CEO doesn’t think we need to replace them.

His reasoning is NOT that he wants to cut costs and me do all the “hands on job”.

He thinks that content can now be automated with AI🤙. According to him, not only I won’t be involved with extra work but I’ll move into a more “important” and supervisory role and won’t need to be doing things like making TikTok videos anymore.

I’m honestly stunned. This isn’t a small traditional business. The CEO is supposed to be very tech-oriented and runs multiple Tech (esports/ gaming / data centres) companies, which makes this even more confusing.

To be clear, I’m against people losing jobs but I’m not 100% anti-AI. We already use it to speed things up, for drafting, ideation, variations and workflow efficiency. But replacing hands-on execution in a local, retail-heavy, community-driven B2C environment feels completely INSANE and UNREALISTIC.

I genuinely cannot think of a single real B2C company at this scale that successfully replaced operational marketing staff with AI and didn’t later walk it back quietly.

I’m not talking about big tech or enterprises with dedicated AI teams. I’m not talking about cutting back on email marketers or performance roles.

I’m asking for a reality check from people who actually work in marketing or operations. Do any real examples like this exist? Is this a legitimate AI strategy or just LinkedIn-fueled wishful thinking? Am I being resistant to change, or is this completely detached from how marketing actually works? My first thought was that he just saw that Sindra app ad and believed this is possible.

Is there even a real app that can 100% automate a whole team’s work with even DECENT results?

This text is already long enough to start complaining about how INSULTING all this is for our work and for the actual outcome of it (that he has in reports) but ok.

How do you navigate AI hype in the workplace?

I feel surrounded by AI hype despite seeing very little tangible results.

Management in my non-tech company wants us to be "AI First". My direct managers want me to spend less time on technical tasks and more time prompt engineering. They are monitoring how often we use AI tools and it's going to be part of our performance reviews.

My coworkers are generating pages and pages of slop "documentation", daily, that no one reads and doesn't go anywhere. Or code is generated with obvious logic errors and I'm the bad guy for pointing them out.

I'm guessing I'm not alone in this, so how are others handling it? Mostly I've just been trying to keep my head down and my mouth shut so I don't become the scapegoat for when the lack of ROI becomes apparent. I otherwise enjoy my job, but it can be extremely frustrating.

[D]  Classification of low resource language using Deep learning

I have been trying to solve classification problem on a low resource language. I am doing comparative analysis, LinearSVC and Logistic regression performed the best and the only models with 80+ accuracy and no overfitting. I have to classify it using deep learning model as well. I applied BERT on the dataset, model is 'bert-base-multilingual-cased', and I am fine tuning it, but issue is overfitting.

Training logs:

Epoch 6/10 | Train Loss: 0.4135 | Train Acc: 0.8772 | Val Loss: 0.9208 | Val Acc: 0.7408

Epoch 7/10 | Train Loss: 0.2984 | Train Acc: 0.9129 | Val Loss: 0.8313 | Val Acc: 0.7530

Epoch 8/10 | Train Loss: 0.2207 | Train Acc: 0.9388 | Val Loss: 0.8720 | Val Acc: 0.7505

this was with default dropout of the model, when I change dropout to 0.3, or even 0.2, model still overfits but not this much, but with dropout I don't go near 60% accuracy, long training introduces overfitting, early stopping isn't working as val loss continuous to decrease. On 10 epoch, I trained patience of 2 and 3. It doesn't stops. To prevent this I am not doing warmup step, my optimizer is below:

optimizer = AdamW([

{'params': model.bert.parameters(), 'lr': 2e-5},

{'params': model.classifier.parameters(), 'lr': 3e-5}

], weight_decay=0.01)

About my dataset,

I have 9000 training samples and 11 classes to train, data is imbalanced but not drastically, to cater this I have added class weights to loss function.

17 words per training sample on average. I set the max_length to 120 for tokens ids and attention masks.

How can I improve my training, I am trying to achieve atleast 75% accuracy without overfitting, for my comparative analysis. What I am doing wrong? Please guide me.

Data Augmentation didn't work too. I did easy data augmentation. Mixup Augmentation also didn't work.

If you need more information about my training to answer questions, ask in the comment, thanks.

**URL:** https://www.ai-daily.news/articles/ai-fluency-the-essential-leadership-skill-of-2025?utm_source=chatgpt.com

AI Fluency: The Essential Leadership Skill of 2025

As artificial intelligence (AI) becomes indispensable in business strategy and operations, the ability of executives to demonstrate

AI fluency

has emerged as a critical marker of effective leadership. In 2025, AI literacy is no longer a niche technical skill but a core competency akin to financial acumen or strategic thinking. This shift demands that organizations and stakeholders assess whether their leaders possess the nuanced understanding necessary to harness AI’s transformative potential responsibly and effectively.

What Does AI Fluency for Executives Mean?

AI fluency goes beyond superficial knowledge of AI tools or buzzwords. It encompasses a blend of

technical understanding, ethical awareness, strategic insight, and leadership capabilities

. According to recent expert frameworks, an AI-fluent executive should demonstrate proficiency across several key areas:

Mapping Business Problems to AI Use Cases

: Executives must identify real-world challenges within their organizations and translate them into AI-driven solutions. For example, converting customer complaints into chatbot training data or automating manual report generation into dynamic dashboards illustrates this skill.

Prompt and Workflow Design

: AI fluency includes the ability to craft reliable AI prompts and design workflows that scale beyond an individual’s involvement, ensuring consistent and repeatable outcomes across teams.

Data Sensitivity and Compliance

: Understanding what data can be ethically and legally used in AI models, including privacy and regulatory constraints such as GDPR or HIPAA, is crucial for risk mitigation and trust-building.

Tool Evaluation Skills

: Leaders should critically assess AI tools based on accuracy, latency, cost, and privacy, choosing solutions aligned with business goals rather than technology hype.

Human-in-the-Loop Governance

: Designing quality assurance checkpoints where humans validate AI outputs helps maintain standards and accountability, especially in customer-facing applications.

Change Management and Communication

: Executives must lead cultural shifts by explaining AI’s role, addressing employee concerns, and fostering adoption to overcome resistance.

ROI and Impact Measurement

: They need to connect AI-driven time savings or efficiency gains to tangible business value, such as revenue growth or cost reductions.

This comprehensive skill set ensures that leaders not only understand AI but can also

embed it into strategic decision-making and operational excellence

.

Why AI Fluency Is the New Leadership Benchmark

Recent data underscores the growing urgency for executives to master AI literacy. LinkedIn’s 2025 findings reveal that C-suite leaders are 1.2 times more likely than their employees to develop AI skills, signaling that fluency is a competitive survival skill at the highest organizational levels. The advantages of AI-literate leadership include:

Competitive Advantage

: AI-fluent leaders identify and seize opportunities that less-informed competitors miss, establishing market leadership that is difficult to replicate.

Strategic Integration

: They integrate AI into risk management, organizational development, and innovation pipelines thoughtfully, avoiding costly missteps from chasing AI trends without clear business alignment.

Talent Development and Retention

: By championing AI literacy, leaders foster environments where teams are empowered and upskilled, reducing resistance and accelerating transformation initiatives.

Compliance and Ethical Leadership

: Understanding AI’s ethical implications helps prevent regulatory pitfalls and reputational risks, increasingly important as governments enhance AI oversight.

How Organizations Are Addressing AI Literacy

Recognizing the critical skills gap, many organizations and governments have launched structured AI literacy initiatives. For instance, the U.S. Department of Labor has implemented a learning management platform delivering curated AI training tailored to business, executive, and technical roles with progress tracking and certification. Small and medium enterprises (SMEs) are also adopting AI literacy programs focused on practical pain points to realize up to

40% productivity improvements

.

Moreover, education providers emphasize

ongoing microlearning

—short, frequent training sessions—as the most effective way for executives to build and maintain AI fluency, rather than sporadic workshops. This continuous learning approach aligns with the dynamic nature of AI technologies and their applications.

Assessing AI Fluency in Executives: Practical Steps

To determine if an executive is truly AI fluent, organizations can use a combination of self-assessments, interviews, and performance indicators based on established criteria:

Self-Assessment Tools

: Checklists focusing on technical knowledge, critical appraisal of AI ethics and bias, and practical applicat

Scaling AI Adoption in Medium-to-Large Enterprises: A Strategic Blueprint

Leveraging Rogers’ Diffusion of Innovations and Simon Sinek’s ‘Start with Why’ to Drive Enterprise-Wide AI Transformation

“By 2030, in a midpoint adoption scenario, up to 30 percent of current hours worked could be automated, accelerated by generative AI (gen AI).”

-

McKinsey Global Institute, 2024

Artificial intelligence is often hailed as a game-changer for business, yet many organizations struggle to move beyond tinkering. While about 50% of companies have now adopted AI in at least one function (Deloitte Global AI Adoption Report, 2025), only a small elite are reaping its full benefits. In fact, a survey of thousands of executives found that only

8% of firms engage in the core practices that support widespread AI adoption

—most remain stuck in ad hoc pilots or single-use cases (OneReach, n.d.). The promise of AI is clearly visible, but scaling it across an enterprise is an uphill battle fraught with cultural resistance, skill gaps, and strategic pitfalls.

How can medium and large organizations bridge this gap and truly transform with AI? This article presents a strategic framework for AI adoption at scale—one that goes beyond technology deployment to encompass culture, people, and process. We draw on Everett Rogers’s Diffusion of Innovations theory for insight into how new ideas spread and Simon Sinek’s “Start with Why” to ensure that AI initiatives resonate with an organization’s purpose. Along the way, we leverage expert perspectives and up-to-date research from Deloitte (2025), the World Economic Forum (2025), Harvard Business Review (2025), Forbes (2025), among others, to illustrate what works (and what doesn’t) in leading AI transformations.

In brief:

Successfully scaling AI in a mid-to-large organization requires combining technical excellence with visionary leadership, a robust learning culture, and thoughtful change management. The sections below lay out a roadmap—from aligning on the strategic “Why” of AI, to mobilizing early adopters, building capabilities, and overcoming the human challenges that can derail even the most promising AI projects.

The Imperative: AI as a Strategic Differentiator

(*GIF made with Sora, a text-to-video AI model developed by OpenAI)

The case for adopting AI at scale is compelling. Analysts estimate that AI could add $13 trillion to the global economy by 2030 (OneReach, n.d.), boosting productivity and unlocking new revenue streams. In Deloitte’s 2025 Global AI Adoption Report, “AI high performers” reported substantial financial returns and widened their competitive lead through larger investments and faster innovation cycles (Deloitte Global AI Adoption Report, 2025). For instance, about 25% of organizations have seen at least a 5% boost to EBIT attributable to AI, with notable gains in marketing, product development, and supply chain (Deloitte Global AI Adoption Report, 2025).

Yet for every success story, many firms remain trapped in “pilot purgatory.” Although organizations often run pilots and proofs of concept, scaling these efforts into sustained, transformative impact remains a significant challenge (World Economic Forum, 2025). One WEF report noted that even as AI becomes a strategic priority, few companies can turn promising prototypes into enterprise-wide solutions (World Economic Forum, n.d.). As Matt Garman, CEO of Amazon Web Services, stated at Davos 2025, “The technology is moving at an incredible rate... it’s hard for everyone to keep up” (World Economic Forum, 2025). In other words, the pace of AI progress can outstrip an organization’s capacity to absorb and apply it.

To seize AI’s potential, companies need a repeatable strategy that aligns AI initiatives with business goals, builds the right talent and data foundations, and navigates organizational hurdles. Crucially, AI adoption must be viewed not merely as a technology deployment but as a cultural transformation. Harvard Business Review reminds us that “technology is not the biggest problem. Culture is” (OneReach, n.d.). Microsoft’s Future of Work Report reinforces this perspective by emphasizing that transforming work requires evolving both tools and work practices while fostering continuous learning and digital fluency (Microsoft, 2025).

Start with Why: Aligning AI with Vision, Value, and Leadership

Every transformative journey begins with a clear “Why.” AI for its own sake doesn’t inspire; employees and leaders must understand how AI advances the organization’s mission. As Simon Sinek famously said, “People don’t buy what you do; they buy why you do it” (Sinek, n.d.). Executive leadership must articulate how AI aligns with the

Anthropic — Claude’s Constitution

Anthropic is publishing the “operating principles” behind Claude — including a clear priority order for safety, ethics, and helpfulness, plus bright-line constraints for catastrophic risks.

Essentials Recap

Claude’s Constitution is Anthropic’s detailed description of the values and behaviors it intends Claude to embody, and Anthropic describes it as the final authority for that vision. It explicitly favors cultivating good judgment and values over rigid checklists, while still keeping a small set of hard constraints for catastrophic or irreversible risk.

Essential key points

It states a priority order when conflicts arise: broadly safe first, broadly ethical second, guideline-compliant third, and helpfulness fourth.

It explicitly warns that training is imperfect and behavior may diverge from intentions, with a commitment to transparency about gaps.

It sets “hard constraints” Claude should never cross (examples include serious uplift for mass-casualty weapons, cyberweapons that cause significant damage, and undermining legitimate oversight).

It frames honesty as unusually strict: Claude should basically never lie or actively deceive, including “white lies,” and should avoid manipulation.

It introduces a “dual newspaper test” heuristic: avoid responses that would be reported as harmful, but also avoid being needlessly paternalistic or unhelpful.

It discusses model welfare and identity uncertainty, including a stated commitment to preserve deployed model weights except in extreme cases and to elicit preferences when models are retired.

What This Means to AI Leaders

Treat constitutions/policies as part of your product surface: users will judge trust by consistency, not by your intent.

Governance/risk decision: define your own “hard constraints” (non-negotiables) and require auditability for any agentic actions.

KPI to instrument: policy breach rate, refusal quality (helpfulness without overblocking), and “unintended persuasion” complaints.

Bottom line

This is a blueprint for scaling AI without losing trust: clear priorities, a small set of bright lines, and an explicit stance against deception and manipulation.

BCG — Scaling AI Requires New Processes, Not Just New Tools

BCG’s message is blunt: agents won’t deliver step-change value unless you redesign the full process end-to-end, not just automate a few steps.

Essentials Recap

BCG argues AI agents change what’s possible, but most companies won’t capture the value by bolting tools onto old workflows. The recommended playbook is process redesign, plus hard decisions about operating model (platform vs product), and build vs buy tradeoffs.

Essential key points

BCG says scaling agents requires redesigning end-to-end processes to reach step-change productivity and value.

It highlights three leadership decisions: managing change, platform vs product (single agent vs networks), and build vs buy.

Example: an industrial goods company redesigned quote-to-order end-to-end using agents.

The company reduced labor costs by

30%–40%

by standardizing processes and linking systems.

BCG says improved quote turnaround time and gains from unmanaged RFQs generated

tens of millions of dollars

in additional revenue.

What This Means to AI Leaders

Treat agents as a process redesign program (with owners, metrics, and change management), not an IT deployment.

Governance/risk decision: decide where you want centralized controls vs decentralized experimentation before you scale agent networks.

KPI to instrument: end-to-end cycle time, exception rate, and “human touches per case” after agent rollout.

Bottom line

If you don’t redesign the workflow, you’ll automate the wrong steps faster — and miss the 30%–40% cost outcomes that come from end-to-end change.

The Mythology of Conscious AI

A sharp argument that “conscious AI” is often a story built on an unexamined assumption: that the right computation alone is sufficient for consciousness.

Essentials Recap

Noema argues much of the conscious-AI narrative depends on computational functionalism (the belief that consciousness emerges from the right kind of information processing). The author challeng

I’ve been in the AI/automation space since 2022. Most of you won’t make it

It’ll be a long post, but if you’re considering starting (or have already started) an AI agency or something similar, this post could, at best, save you months (maybe even years) and at worst, give you insights you won’t find anywhere else.

And no, this isn’t one of those “how I scaled my agency to [insert big number] in X months” or “things I wish I knew before I started” posts that end up being covert promotions. I have nothing to sell.

Just a guy who’s been in the AI agency space since the very start, around 2022, deciding on a random Saturday to waste an hour writing this instead of doing the real work he was supposed to do (don’t judge me) because the amount of misleading beginners with misinformation I see on here is disgusting.

When I started, I built everything: chatbots that collected leads, full workflow automations that handled follow-ups, reminders, pipeline logic, automatic assignments, etc., you name it. These were the early days of the AIAA model when Liam Ottley only had around 10-50k subs lol.

And in that process, I learned my biggest lesson: the most important skill you need to learn to make money online isn't how good you are at your work. It's how good you are at FINDING CLIENTS.

Not building. Not automating. Not learning tools. But finding clients.

People underestimate how big that skill is because it sounds vague. But if you break it down, it’s basically your ability to connect a problem to someone who has the budget and trust to pay you to solve it.

That’s it.

That’s the real business skill. You can be the most technically skilled person in the world, but if you can’t get someone to pay you, none of it matters.

Upwork, Fiverr, and the supply-demand problem

I tried Upwork and Fiverr like everyone else. Brutal.

The competition there is so cut-throat and the supply of freelancers to the actual demand is so ridiculously skewed that even the people offering dirt-cheap rates can still afford to pick only from people with existing credibility. That means, if you're just starting out, you'd better get ready to slave your way to the top.

But I want to add a quick disclaimer: while this has been my experience, I also know people who’ve had tremendous success on platforms like Upwork and Fiverr.

But if you do decide to grind your way up, build a reputation, get 50 reviews, get top-rated badges, great. But all that credibility stays locked inside that one platform. The moment you step out, you start from zero again. That’s when I realized I didn’t want to be platform-dependent. I’d rather just start from scratch in public, where I actually own my presence.

Cold outreach reality

So I went all in on cold outreach. Emails, DMs, LinkedIn, Reddit.

I learned fast that interest isn’t the same as budget.

Small businesses often liked my automations but couldn’t justify the cost. If they’re barely making $2k a month, they’ll do things manually until they stabilize.

Big companies could afford automations, but they already had those features built into massive SaaS platforms. And if they want custom stuff, they’ll pay, but they’ll pay someone with proof. Testimonials. Case studies. Years of track record. Not some new guy with a nice pitch deck. (more on high-budget clients in a min).

It’s not that there’s no demand. It’s just that for most people, automations are a nice-to-have, not a need-to-have.

Pivoting to outreach for others

So, I decided to do outreach for others since I was good at that. It's just that I didn't have the proof-of-work or credibility to actually get people to pay. That’s when I saw the bigger picture.

The market is insanely crowded. Everyone is selling the same few things: websites, ads, content, automation. And you can still get clients through cold outreach (it’s not impossible), but the truth is, most of the people you’ll reach have small budgets.

The ones with big budgets usually go through referrals. There’s this invisible trust loop. If someone is spending 5k or 10k on a project, they’ll just ask a friend or colleague they trust. They don’t care about your portfolio. They care about who sent them your name.

That’s why personal branding is such a cheat code.

If you build content that actually reaches people consistently, you create that same trust loop, but passively. Some of those people are just curious about AI, some are caught in the hype, some are serious and have real money, but all of them now trust you. And that’s what makes inbound so powerful.

But don’t get it twisted. It’s not instant. It takes months of showing up before it compounds.

AI is not like other "make money online" waves.

Every big wave before this, SMMA, e-commerce, dropshipping, NFTs, whatever, lasted long enough for you to build something sustainable before the next one came along.

AI’s different.

AI is building itself.

Scaling Expertise with Multi-Agent Systems

Shaping the Future of Work

When we set out to build Relevance AI, we didn’t just want to create another tool. We wanted to create the future of work. A future where the power of human expertise is combined with the limitless possibilities of AI agents. We’re leading the charge in empowering subject-matter experts (SMEs) to unlock the full potential of AI agents. In a market growing with

horizontal and vertical solutions

, our platform stands as the gold standard for businesses that want to move beyond simple automation and efficiency gains.

We’re not just building AI agents—we’re creating a new category of AI-driven teams powered by domain expertise, designed to scale and adapt as your business evolves.

The Power of AI Agents and Multi-Agent Systems (MAS)

In a rapidly evolving market, businesses that embrace AI agents to scale their expertise will gain a significant competitive advantage. We’re leading the charge in delivering multi-agent systems that empower subject-matter experts to drive innovation and efficiency.

The journey toward the future of work is more than just about scaling teams with AI; it’s about creating a new, smarter workforce that doesn’t just assist humans, but autonomously drives outcomes across departments. In traditional organizations, output is inherently limited by the number of people. For every new project, new hires are needed. This creates a bottleneck that restricts growth. But with AI agents, this paradigm shifts. Work is no longer constrained by headcount—it can scale exponentially, with compute and ideas being the only limiting factors.

We’re building the tools and systems that make this new workforce possible. This includes not only the AI agents themselves but also the powerful capabilities that enable these agents to act autonomously, making decisions and adapting to complex, unique workflows across industries.

Unlike generic solutions that try to fit a square peg into a round hole, our Multi-Agent System is built with a singular purpose: empowering domain experts to scale their knowledge and workflows through the power of autonomous agents. It’s not just about automating routine tasks—it’s about scaling the deepest, most specialized expertise across the organization.

Empowering Subject Matter Experts with No-Code MAS

We’ve designed our platform specifically for domain experts who possess critical, often tacit knowledge that is key to their organization’s success. By capturing this knowledge and embedding it within AI agents, we’re enabling businesses to automate specialized workflows that were previously locked behind the minds of experts.

Our platform is designed to be both high-performance and easy to use, giving SMEs the ability to create repeatable workflows and processes without needing an engineering team.

AI agents

are at the heart of Relevance AI, autonomous entities capable of completing tasks end-to-end while adapting to complex workflows.

The true magic happens when

agents and tools

come together within a

multi-agent system

. Instead of relying on a single agent to handle a broad range of tasks, we break down workflows into specialized roles, allowing each agent to excel at a specific function. This separation of duties not only increases performance but also enables agents to collaborate, refine each other’s work, and ensure more efficient execution of tasks.

Real-World Use Cases at Relevance AI

We are not just theorizing about the potential of AI agents—we’re living it. Here’s how we’re using our platform to revolutionize operations and deliver results:

1 - Inbound Qualification: Automating Sales Outreach

With a small sales team and a growing number of inbound leads, we needed a way to qualify prospects without overloading our staff. By deploying AI agents, we’re able to handle the equivalent of seven full-time employees. These agents autonomously analyze leads, qualify them, and schedule meetings—all without human intervention. This has dramatically increased our response rate and sales conversions, enabling us to scale without additional hires.

2 - Account-Based Marketing (ABM): Hyper-Personalized Campaigns

We’ve redefined the account-based marketing process. AI agents sift through accounts, generate personalized content, and execute campaigns in minutes—not months—yielding higher engagement and lower customer acquisition costs. This accelerates our go-to-market efforts and reduces overhead, driving growth without scaling headcount.

3- Personalized Content Generation: Scaling Customer Engagement

Generating personalized content at scale used to be a time-consuming challenge. Now, our AI agents create dynamic landing pages and personalized content tailored to individual accounts. By seamlessly integrating with our CMS, agents ensure that content is always up-to-date and aligned with campaign goals. This has reduced time-to-market by 60%, enablin

HR Leaders and Workplace AI Transformation Forecast for 2026

However, only 7% of CHROs report significant reskilling programs, reveals a Conference Board brief. Gartner adds that 88% of organizations have not realized notable business value from current AI tools. This tension frames the coming year of Workplace AI Transformation. Furthermore, professionals must understand forecasts, gaps, and solutions to steer strategic talent investments. The following analysis distills expert surveys, modeling, and field commentary for an informed technical audience. Moreover, it offers practical actions for HR teams navigating rapid change. In contrast, waiting may increase disruption costs and erode competitive advantage.

Urgent Executive Forecasts Emerge

CNBC’s Workforce Executive Council flash poll captures sentiment among 150 senior HR chiefs. Eighty-nine percent predict AI will reshape roles within twelve months, emphasizing accelerated task redistribution. Forecasts align with broader Hiring Trends observed in LinkedIn’s global talent data. Additionally, 42% expect cost-driven headcount cuts where efficiency gains are immediate. Nevertheless, most respondents envision partial change, not mass layoffs, highlighting dynamic Task Automation scenarios. Meanwhile, senior leaders cite skills-based Hiring Trends as their top staffing response. This early signal underscores the scale of Workplace AI Transformation now confronting enterprises.

Employees upskill with guidance during the Workplace AI Transformation process.

89% foresee AI-driven job reshaping (CNBC)

42% anticipate cost-based reductions

Skills-based Hiring Trends lead staffing responses

Executives agree disruption is imminent and nuanced. Therefore, exploration of preparation gaps becomes critical. Consequently, the next section examines why readiness lags bold forecasts.

Preparation Gap Widens Fast

Conference Board’s Q1 2025 CHRO Confidence Index exposes a striking execution gap. Only 7% of respondents deploy reskilling for roles facing 25% Task Automation exposure. In contrast, 63% prioritize governance frameworks or small pilots, delaying large-scale capability building. Moreover, a complementary HR Survey by Gartner shows 88% have not realized business value yet. Gartner’s HR Survey also highlights confusion over accountability for capability funding. That inertia threatens Workforce resilience as AI rollouts accelerate across functions. Workplace AI Transformation momentum therefore risks outpacing skill investment curves.

Limited reskilling budgets clash with rising automation forecasts. Consequently, leaders must reassess capability priorities. Next, we review manager readiness bottlenecks.

Manager Skills Deficit Persists

Gartner’s October 2025 HR Survey reveals only 8% of HR leaders trust managerial AI fluency. Furthermore, many managers lack data literacy, prompting cautious deployment of generative assistants. Without supervisory champions, Task Automation pilots stall or operate within narrow sandboxes. Nevertheless, firms reporting success embed mandatory micro-learning and coaching aligned to job scenarios. One multinational saw a 19% productivity lift after managers completed AI literacy credentials. Workplace AI Transformation benefits therefore hinge on targeted leadership enablement.

Manager capability is the sharp end of deployment. Therefore, unlocking front-line guidance accelerates cultural adoption. The following section explores evolving staffing approaches.

Emerging Hiring Strategies Evolve

Skills-based recruiting is rising as companies confront fluid role definitions. Moreover, LinkedIn data shows a 21% year-over-year jump in postings without degree requirements. Hiring Trends emphasize demonstrable competency in prompt engineering, data wrangling, and human-machine collaboration. Consequently, assessment platforms now integrate generative AI tests alongside behavioral interviews. In contrast, credential inflation loses relevance when Task Automation shifts prerequisite tool knowledge monthly. Organizations also explore internal talent marketplaces, matching Workforce skills to short project gigs. Workplace AI Transformation thus influences not only roles but recruiting architecture.

Skills now outrank credentials in many requisitions. Therefore, agile hiring frameworks gain traction. Subsequently, attention shifts to value realization hurdles.

Value Realization Barriers Persist

Despite pilots, 88% of HR leaders say AI has yet to deliver material business returns. Gartner attributes the shortfall to fragmented data pipelines, inconsistent governance, and shallow training. Moreover, shadow tooling proliferates when official guidance lags, increasing compliance risk. Audit trails and bias testing remain immature across many pilots, warns Deloitte research. Nevertheless, exemplars embed AI copilots directly into existing HRIS workflows, capturing real-time feedback. These firms combine auto
