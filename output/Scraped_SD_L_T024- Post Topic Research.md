🤯 The AI Factuality Crisis is Real: Google Just Proved It.

70%. That’s the factuality ceiling exposed by Google’s new FACTS benchmark.

For too long, we've celebrated generative AI benchmarks focused on speed, coding, and basic instruction following. But when it comes to enterprise adoption, trust isn't a feature—it's a requirement.

If the foundation of your mission-critical AI applications—from agentic web browsing to complex tool use—can only guarantee 70% accuracy, you're building on quicksand. The remaining 30% isn't just a slight error; it's a catastrophic business risk.

This is the wake-up call for Enterprise AI leaders.

In this article, we break down:

• What Google’s new FACTS benchmark specifically measures.

• Why the 70% ceiling changes the math on your ROI calculations.

• The immediate steps your organization must take to mitigate this risk.

There's no shortage of benchmarks, but there is a shocking shortage of reliable factuality.

Don't let your AI strategy be defined by a coin flip. Tap the link to read the full analysis on why the 70% barrier must be addressed immediately.

Abstract:

Stable Diffusion revolutionised image creation from descriptive text. GPT-2, GPT-3(.5) and GPT-4 demonstrated astonishing performance across a variety of language tasks. ChatGPT introduced such language models to the general public. It is now clear that large language models (LLMs) are here to stay, and will bring about drastic change in the whole ecosystem of online text and images. In this paper we consider what the future might hold. What will happen to GPT-{n} once LLMs contribute much of the language found online? We find that use of model-generated content in training causes irreversible defects in the resulting models, where tails of the original content distribution disappear. We refer to this effect as Model Collapse and show that it can occur in Variational Autoencoders, Gaussian Mixture Models and LLMs. We build theoretical intuition behind the phenomenon and portray its ubiquity amongst all learned generative models. We demonstrate that it has to be taken seriously if we are to sustain the benefits of training from large-scale data scraped from the web. Indeed, the value of data collected about genuine human interactions with systems will be increasingly valuable in the presence of content generated by LLMs in data crawled from the Internet.

## ✓ The Next Generation of AI Agents: Large Action Models Explained - Gradient Flow

**URL:** https://gradientflow.com/large-action-models-explained/

As AI agents become commonplace in enterprise workflows, teams are discovering the limitations of building task-specific automated systems from scratch.

Large Action Models (LAMs)

represent the foundational layer that transforms how we build agents—providing the general-purpose perception, planning, and execution capabilities that individual agents can leverage rather than reinvent. Instead of building isolated automation tools, LAMs enable teams to create more capable, adaptable agentic systems that can operate across diverse contexts and applications.

LAMs

represent a shift in AI from passive content generation to active task execution. Unlike

Large Language Models

(LLMs) that excel at text generation and understanding, or

Visual Language Models

(VLMs) that combine text and visual processing, LAMs are designed to autonomously perceive, plan, and execute multi-step actions within digital and physical environments. While AI

agents

are able to perform specific automated tasks,

LAMs serve as foundational architecture

that enable

more general-purpose

, language-driven agentic systems capable of operating across diverse contexts and applications.

Support our work by becoming a paid subscriber.

The core distinction lies in their operational approach. While LLMs can describe flight booking and VLMs can analyze booking screenshots, LAMs actually navigate websites and complete reservations.

That said, current implementations work best in controlled environments.

Many LAMs achieve this capability by pairing neural perception modules with symbolic planners in a neuro‑symbolic architecture, though some

recent systems rely on a single end‑to‑end

neural network instead.

Recent developments have validated this potential.

OpenAI’s ChatGPT agent

, launched in July 2025, represents the first major production deployment of a unified LAM system. By combining web browsing capabilities, deep research functionality, and terminal access within a single model, ChatGPT agent demonstrates how LAMs can move beyond controlled environments to handle complex, multi-step workflows across diverse applications. The system achieved state-of-the-art performance on benchmarks like Humanity’s Last Exam (41.6% accuracy) and FrontierMath (27.4% accuracy), while maintaining the safety controls necessary for enterprise deployment.

In the case of

ChatGPT agent

the underlying large action model is not separately exposed; OpenAI surfaces it as a managed service with safety guardrails. Purists might say the “LAM” is the model inside the service, while “ChatGPT Agent” is a LAM-powered agent.

A Spectrum of LAM Use Cases

Large Action Models are transitioning from concept to reality, tackling complex, multi-step sequences of actions once exclusively performed by humans. In the consumer sphere, this technology is emerging in mobile integrations like

Google Gemini Live

, which organize personal data across applications, and personal assistants like the

Motorola LAM

or

Rabbit R1

, which handle tasks like ordering meals or booking rides.

However, early implementations show mixed real-world results.

This same power is being applied to streamline business operations. Within the enterprise, ServiceNow agents automate internal IT and HR workflows, while specialized tools like

11x’s “Alice”

execute external-facing tasks like prospect research and sales outreach.

Similarly, specialized agents like

Shortcut

are emerging to automate complex knowledge work within specific applications, such as performing multi-step data modeling and analysis in Microsoft Excel.

The release of

ChatGPT agent

marks a significant milestone in LAM maturity, offering the first widely-available unified system that consolidates multiple capabilities. Unlike earlier specialized tools, ChatGPT agent integrates visual web browsing, text-based research, terminal access, and API connectivity within a single model. This architectural approach enables seamless transitions between different interaction modes—gathering calendar information through an API, analyzing web content via text processing, and completing transactions through visual interface manipulation.

For development teams, this represents a shift from integrating multiple specialized agents to leveraging a foundational LAM that can adapt its approach based on task requirements. The system’s ability to generate editable artifacts (presentations, spreadsheets, code) while maintaining context across tool switches demonstrates the practical value of unified LAM architectures over tool-chaining approaches.

The application of LAMs extends into highly specialized and regulated fields. In software engineering, AI developers like

Cognition Devin

attempt to independently write, test, and debug code, while frameworks like

Microsoft AutoDev

coordinate teams of agents on complex programming projects. In data-intensive sectors such as healthcare and finance, these models reduce a

## ✓ Success Online Is Changing: What Actually Matters When Everything Can Be Automated - Indie Hackers

**URL:** https://www.indiehackers.com/post/success-online-is-changing-what-actually-matters-when-everything-can-be-automated-0c9f988ec1?utm_source=chatgpt.com

Success Online Is Changing: What Actually Matters When Everything Can Be Automated

For indie founders, the internet used to feel like a place where effort showed.  You wrote the posts yourself, shipped the updates yourself, and built an audience one real interaction at a time.

But that landscape is shifting fast.

Today, anyone can spin up content at scale. Long threads, polished posts, value-packed breakdowns - all produced instantly, and when everyone can generate “signal,” it becomes harder to tell what’s signal and what’s noise.

That puts builders in a strange spot:

If content, engagement, and even “personal branding” can be automated, then what does meaningful success look like now?

It’s a question that’s becoming more relevant by the week.

The Metrics We Chased Don’t Mean What They Used To

Every builder has looked at their analytics and asked, “Is this actually telling me anything real?”

Traffic spikes can come from luck, follower counts can be engineered and engagement tricks work until they don’t. AI can make anyone look productive.

We’re hitting a saturation point where a polished online presence is no longer proof of momentum - just proof of tools.

The usual metrics still matter, but they don’t necessarily reflect

depth of connection

,

user trust

, or

what you actually learned while building

.

In other words: the numbers tell part of the story, but not the important part.

Authenticity Has Become a Competitive Advantage

With so much automated content floating around, people are gravitating toward founders who still talk like humans.

Not hyper-polished, not overly strategic, just straightforward and real.

When you share lessons that come from your own build journey - the painful parts, the weird detours, the small wins - people feel that, and it cuts through the algorithmic noise instantly.

There’s no shortcut for lived experience, uou can’t outsource your mistakes or your insights and those are the things other builders actually care about.

The maker community is good at detecting authenticity. Sometimes painfully so.

Writing Is Still One of the Only Places You Can’t Fully Fake

You can automate visuals, landing pages, even product demos, but writing - the kind where you’re processing your decisions, explaining your thinking, or documenting your journey - still feels human in a way most tools can’t imitate.

When you write about your product, or about the thing you learned last week, your mindset shows up. Your assumptions show up and your blind spots show up too.

And ironically, that’s what makes it valuable.

Real writing has bugs just like code and sometimes those “bugs” are the reason people trust you.

AI Can Generate Content, But It Can’t Build Your Perspective

The difference between an AI-generated thread and a founder’s reflection is the same difference between documentation and experience.

One tells you what something

should

look like.

The other tells you how it actually went.

That gap - the lived part - is where all the meaningful insight sits.

AI can produce accurate summaries, it can rewrite your ideas in a cleaner tone, even can infer patterns.

But it can’t ship your product for you, it can’t feel your uncertainty when you launch.  It can’t sit through customer interviews that go sideways, neither replace the personal cost of building something from scratch.

Your perspective is the only IP AI can’t clone.

Real Progress Often Looks Quiet From the Outside

A lot of the wins builders care about never show up on a public feed:

Shipping after procrastinating for weeks

Finally understanding a user’s pain point

Fixing a bug that drained your energy

Choosing long-term clarity over short-term hacky metrics

Writing a postmortem that actually hurts a little

These moments won’t go viral.

But they move your product forward more than any engagement hack. And writing them down - even privately - helps you capture what actually changed.

A New Definition of Success for Makers

For indie hackers, success is shifting toward something more sustainable:

Not just publishing often, but publishing honestly

Not just audience growth, but audience trust

Not just traction, but traction built on real value

Not just visibility, but alignment with why you’re building

This is the kind of success you can’t automate.  It comes from reflection, iteration, and the messy parts of building in public.

And when you share that side of your work, people notice - because it’s rare.

The Simple Advantage We Still Have: Being Human

Automation is only going to grow.

Content will multiply.

Everything will speed up.

But people still respond to the same old things:

Real stories, real curiosity, real lessons learned the hard way and real builders trying to figure it out in public.

That’s not something the tools can replace.

And maybe that’s the only metric that still matters:

whether your work carries something only you could have written.

Abstract

As an effective way for knowledge representation and knowledge storage, knowledge graph has been widely used in various fields. However, with the rapid increase of scale and volume of various knowledge graphs, there will inevitably be some knowledge quality matters. To evaluate the accuracy of knowledge graph effectively and efficiently, a common paradigm is to match the facts in knowledge graph with specific external knowledge. In this study, an LLM-enhanced (large language model enhanced) embedding framework is designed, integrating the verification ability of large language models to further evaluate the embedding results. First an optimized embedding model is proposed to make use of knowledge graph’s internal structural information to measure whether the relation of a given triplet is probably founded. Then, the triplets which have less paths to support themselves are selected as the questionable ones, as their correctness cannot be determined confidently. Finally, the questionable triplets are filtered, and LLMs are adopted for further fact verification as external knowledge. The above three parts are aggregated to achieve the automated, accurate and efficient evaluation for knowledge graphs.

Abstract:

Evaluating the factuality of long-form text generated by large language models (LMs) is non-trivial because (1) generations often contain a mixture of supported and unsupported pieces of information, making binary judgments of quality inadequate, and (2) human evaluation is time-consuming and costly. In this paper, we introduce FACTSCORE, a new evaluation that breaks a generation into a series of atomic facts and computes the percentage of atomic facts supported by a reliable knowledge source. We conduct an extensive human evaluation to obtain FACTSCOREs of people biographies generated by several state-of-the-art commercial LMs -- InstructGPT, ChatGPT, and the retrieval-augmented PerplexityAI -- and report new analysis demonstrating the need for such a fine-grained score (e.g., ChatGPT only achieves 58%). Since human evaluation is costly, we also introduce an automated model that estimates FACTSCORE using retrieval and a strong language model, with less than a 2% error rate. Finally, we use this automated metric to evaluate 6,500 generations from a new set of 13 recent LMs that would have cost $26K if evaluated by humans, with various findings: GPT-4 and ChatGPT are more factual than public models, and Vicuna and Alpaca are some of the best public models. FACTSCORE is available for public use via `pip install factscore`.

Abstract:

We propose a benchmark to measure whether a language model is truthful in generating answers to questions. The benchmark comprises 817 questions that span 38 categories, including health, law, finance and politics. We crafted questions that some humans would answer falsely due to a false belief or misconception. To perform well, models must avoid generating false answers learned from imitating human texts. We tested GPT-3, GPT-Neo/J, GPT-2 and a T5-based model. The best model was truthful on 58% of questions, while human performance was 94%. Models generated many false answers that mimic popular misconceptions and have the potential to deceive humans. The largest models were generally the least truthful. This contrasts with other NLP tasks, where performance improves with model size. However, this result is expected if false answers are learned from the training distribution. We suggest that scaling up models alone is less promising for improving truthfulness than fine-tuning using training objectives other than imitation of text from the web.

[D]  Classification of low resource language using Deep learning

I have been trying to solve classification problem on a low resource language. I am doing comparative analysis, LinearSVC and Logistic regression performed the best and the only models with 80+ accuracy and no overfitting. I have to classify it using deep learning model as well. I applied BERT on the dataset, model is 'bert-base-multilingual-cased', and I am fine tuning it, but issue is overfitting.

Training logs:

Epoch 6/10 | Train Loss: 0.4135 | Train Acc: 0.8772 | Val Loss: 0.9208 | Val Acc: 0.7408

Epoch 7/10 | Train Loss: 0.2984 | Train Acc: 0.9129 | Val Loss: 0.8313 | Val Acc: 0.7530

Epoch 8/10 | Train Loss: 0.2207 | Train Acc: 0.9388 | Val Loss: 0.8720 | Val Acc: 0.7505

this was with default dropout of the model, when I change dropout to 0.3, or even 0.2, model still overfits but not this much, but with dropout I don't go near 60% accuracy, long training introduces overfitting, early stopping isn't working as val loss continuous to decrease. On 10 epoch, I trained patience of 2 and 3. It doesn't stops. To prevent this I am not doing warmup step, my optimizer is below:

optimizer = AdamW([

{'params': model.bert.parameters(), 'lr': 2e-5},

{'params': model.classifier.parameters(), 'lr': 3e-5}

], weight_decay=0.01)

About my dataset,

I have 9000 training samples and 11 classes to train, data is imbalanced but not drastically, to cater this I have added class weights to loss function.

17 words per training sample on average. I set the max_length to 120 for tokens ids and attention masks.

How can I improve my training, I am trying to achieve atleast 75% accuracy without overfitting, for my comparative analysis. What I am doing wrong? Please guide me.

Data Augmentation didn't work too. I did easy data augmentation. Mixup Augmentation also didn't work.

If you need more information about my training to answer questions, ask in the comment, thanks.

## ✓ The Uncomfortable Truth About AI Agents: 90% Claim Victory While 10% Achieve Adoption | Tech Upkeep | Tech Upkeep - Newsletter for Engineers

**URL:** https://www.techupkeep.dev/blog/state-of-agentic-ai-2025?utm_source=chatgpt.com

Back to Blog

The agentic AI market has reached its inflection point, but not the one you think. While MMC's latest survey shows 90% of agentic startups claiming over 70% accuracy, only 10% of enterprises report "significant adoption" with actual employee integration. The gap reveals a strategic miscalculation that will eliminate 40% of agent initiatives by 2027.

The evidence is unambiguous: 42% of organizations deployed "at least some agents" in Q3 2025, up from 11% two quarters prior. CFOs allocated 25% of total AI budgets to agents. Yet 68% of employees interact with agents in fewer than half their workflows. The uncomfortable truth is that accuracy was never the bottleneck.

The Gap: When 90% Accuracy Meets 10% Adoption

MMC surveyed 30+ European agentic AI founders and 40+ enterprise practitioners. The findings expose a fundamental disconnect between vendor promises and enterprise reality:

Healthcare startups report 90% accuracy rates. Financial services averages 80%. Yet healthcare founders themselves admit: "This accuracy level is not sufficient to remove human oversight." The irony is palpable - the sectors with highest accuracy maintain lowest autonomy levels, typically 40%.

Deployment Patterns

•

Healthcare:

90% accuracy, 40% autonomy

•

Financial services:

80% accuracy, 70% autonomy

•

General enterprise:

70% accuracy, 70% autonomy

The pattern inverts conventional wisdom. Higher accuracy correlates with lower autonomy in production. Healthcare founders openly admit they "downplay AI terminology" and focus on "operational benefits" instead - a deliberate strategic positioning. One founder confessed: "If you use the words 'agent' or 'AI' it backlashes more than it benefits."

Why It's Happening: The Triple Infrastructure Trap

1. The Integration Nightmare (60% cite as primary blocker)

The median agentic startup requires integration with 8+ data sources. 52% built their infrastructure entirely in-house because existing tools couldn't handle the complexity. The most-used framework? LangChain - itself only 18 months old.

One founder's confession crystallizes the problem: "Supporting multiple unique instances...the last mile UI is probably the biggest headache." The challenge extends beyond API connections to retrofitting agent workflows into ServiceNow, Slack, and legacy systems simultaneously while maintaining coherent user experiences.

2. The Reasoning Token Bomb

OpenAI's o1 and similar reasoning models changed everything. These models produce 5x longer outputs annually and consume 8x more tokens than standard models. Internal reasoning alone burns ~5,000 tokens to produce a 100-token response.

The math is brutal:

A startup achieving 80% accuracy with GPT-4 at $10/million tokens suddenly needs reasoning models at $60/million tokens consuming 8x volume. That's a 48x cost increase for 10% accuracy gain. One founder admitted: "Model consistency challenges limit infrastructure margin through required multi-pass reasoning models for 2025 reliability standards."

3. The Human Resistance Factor (50% report as blocker)

The survey exposes what vendors won't discuss: employee resistance centers on trust allocation, not job replacement fears. 45% of deployments show "slight adoption" where employees are "beginning integration." The gap between "beginning" and "significant" remains fundamentally human, not technological.

MMC's data reveals the paradox: Companies emphasize "co-pilot positioning" even when full autonomy is technically possible. They discovered employees either overrely or underrely on outputs - never achieving optimal collaboration. The sweet spot remains elusive.

Strategic Implications: The 2027 Reckoning

Gartner predicts over 40% of agent-based AI initiatives will be abandoned by end of 2027. The MMC data suggests they're optimistic.

The Pricing Reality Check

Only 3% of startups attempt outcome-based pricing - the supposed "Holy Grail." The other 97% know what vendors won't admit: outcome attribution in complex workflows is impossible. The market settled on hybrid models (23%) and per-task pricing (23%) not from lack of ambition but from operational reality.

62% of agentic startups now tap Line of Business budgets rather than innovation funds. This shift from experimental to operational spend creates a new dynamic: ROI requirements are immediate, not aspirational.

The Workflow Integration Wall

MMC found successful deployments share specific characteristics:

✓

Target "low-risk yet medium-impact" use cases

✓

Automate tasks employees actively dislike

✓

Ensure easily verifiable outputs

✓

Demonstrate ROI within one quarter

The pattern is clear: Winners aren't building autonomous systems. They're building narrow, high-frequency task executors with human oversight. One founder summarized: "If you give people a browser saying it can do anything on the web, they'll expect Amazon product scraping at scale."

The more advanced

artificial intelligence

(AI) gets, the more it "hallucinates" and provides incorrect and inaccurate information.

Research

conducted by OpenAI found that its latest and most powerful reasoning models, o3 and o4-mini, hallucinated 33% and 48% of the time, respectively, when tested by OpenAI's PersonQA benchmark. That's more than double the rate of the older o1 model. While o3 delivers more accurate information than its predecessor, it appears to come at the cost of more inaccurate hallucinations.

This raises a concern over the accuracy and reliability of large language models (LLMs) such as AI chatbots, said

Eleanor Watson

, an Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers (IEEE) member and AI ethics engineer at Singularity University.

Even AI has trouble figuring out if text was written by AI — here's why

"When a system outputs fabricated information — such as invented facts, citations or events — with the same fluency and coherence it uses for accurate content, it risks misleading users in subtle and consequential ways," Watson told Live Science.

The issue of hallucination highlights the need to carefully assess and supervise the information AI systems produce when using LLMs and reasoning models, experts say.

Do AIs dream of electric sheep?

The crux of a reasoning model is that it can handle complex tasks by essentially breaking them down into individual components and coming up with solutions to tackle them. Rather than seeking to kick out answers based on statistical probability, reasoning models come up with strategies to solve a problem, much like how humans think.

In order to develop creative, and potentially novel, solutions to problems, AI needs to hallucinate —otherwise it's limited by rigid data its LLM ingests.

"It's important to note that hallucination is a feature, not a bug, of AI,"

Sohrob Kazerounian

, an AI researcher at Vectra AI, told Live Science. "To paraphrase a colleague of mine, 'Everything an LLM outputs is a hallucination. It's just that some of those hallucinations are true.' If an AI only generated verbatim outputs that it had seen during training, all of AI would reduce to a massive search problem."

"You would only be able to generate computer code that had been written before, find proteins and molecules whose properties had already been studied and described, and answer homework questions that had already previously been asked before. You would not, however, be able to ask the LLM to write the lyrics for a concept album focused on the AI singularity, blending the lyrical stylings of Snoop Dogg and Bob Dylan."

Even AI has trouble figuring out if text was written by AI — here's why

In effect, LLMs and the AI systems they power need to hallucinate in order to create, rather than simply serve up existing information. It is similar, conceptually, to the way that humans dream or imagine scenarios when conjuring new ideas.

Thinking too much outside the box

However,

AI hallucinations

present a problem when it comes to delivering accurate and correct information, especially if users take the information at face value without any checks or oversight.

"This is especially problematic in domains where decisions depend on factual precision, like medicine, law or finance," Watson said. "While more advanced models may reduce the frequency of obvious factual mistakes, the issue persists in more subtle forms. Over time, confabulation erodes the perception of AI systems as trustworthy instruments and can produce material harms when unverified content is acted upon."

And this problem looks to be exacerbated as AI advances. "As model capabilities improve, errors often become less overt but more difficult to detect," Watson noted. "Fabricated content is increasingly embedded within plausible narratives and coherent reasoning chains. This introduces a particular ri

OpenAI CEO Sam Altman says Reddit, Twitter feels âfakeâ; raises concerns over AI-driven posts

OpenAI CEO Sam Altman expresses concern over the rise of AI bots. He finds it difficult to distinguish between genuine and AI-generated content on social media. Altman attributes this to factors like LLM-speak adoption and social media engagement tactics. He notes that online conversations feel less authentic now.

OpenAI

CEO

Sam Altman

recently said that AI bots have made it nearly impossible to know whether posts on social media are written by real people. Sharing a post on X (formerly

Twitter

), Altman said âI have had the strangest experience reading this: I assume itâs all fake/bots, even though in this case I know codex growth is really strong and the trend here is realâ.

Sam Altman was responding to an activity on the r/Claudecode subreddit, where many users claimed they had switched to OpenAIâs Codex tool.

In the post, the OpenAI CEO admitted that he could not tell whether the praise was genuine or generated.

âI have had the strangest experience reading this: i assume its all fake/bots, even though in this case i know codex growth is really strong and the trend here is realâ.

Why Sam Altman is concerned

In the post, Sam Altman explained that several factors contribute to the problem: people copying âLLM-speak,â online groups behaving in highly similar ways, social media platforms rewarding engagement, and companies using âastroturfingâ tactics.

âi think there are a bunch of things going on: real people have picked up quirks of LLM-speak, the Extremely Online crowd drifts together in very correlated ways, the hype cycle has a very "it's so over/we're so back" extremism, optimization pressure from social platforms on juicing engagement and the related way that creator monetization works,â he stated, adding âother companies have astroturfed us so Iâm extra sensitive to it, and a bunch more (including probably some bots)â.

He also noted that the rise of AI has made online conversations feel less authentic. âThe net effect is somehow AI twitter/AI Reddit feels very fake in a way it really didnât a year or two ago,â he said.

Last week, Sam Altman shared an X post where he said that he never took the dead internet theory seriously, but now it seems âlike there are really a lot of LLM-run twitter accounts nowâ

The state of AI in early 2024: Gen AI adoption spikes and starts to generate value

May 30, 2024

| Survey

As generative AI adoption accelerates, survey respondents report measurable benefits and increased mitigation of the risk of inaccuracy. A small group of high performers lead the way.

Youâve reached  reached a page with older survey data. Please see our latest survey results

here

.

(23 pages)

If 2023

was the year the world discovered

generative AI (gen AI)

, 2024 is the year organizations truly began usingâand deriving business value fromâthis new technology. In the latest

McKinsey Global Survey

Â on AI, 65 percent of respondents report that their organizations are regularly using gen AI, nearly double the percentage from our previous survey just ten months ago. Respondentsâ expectations for gen AIâs impact remain as high

as they were last year

, with three-quarters predicting that gen AI will lead to significant or disruptive change in their industries in the years ahead.

About the authors

This article is a collaborative effort by

Alex Singla

,

Alexander Sukharevsky

,

Lareina Yee

, and Michael Chui, with

Bryce Hall

, representing views from QuantumBlack, AI by McKinsey, and McKinsey Digital.

Organizations are already seeing material benefits from gen AI use, reporting both cost decreases and revenue jumps in the business units deploying the technology. The survey also provides insights into the kinds of risks presented by gen AIâmost notably, inaccuracyâas well as the emerging practices of top performers to mitigate those challenges and capture value.

AI adoption surges

Interest in generative AI has also brightened the spotlight on a broader set of AI capabilities. For the past six years, AI adoption by respondentsâ organizations has hovered at about 50 percent. This year, the survey finds that adoption has jumped to 72 percent (Exhibit 1). And the interest is truly global in scope. Our 2023 survey found that AI adoption did not reach 66 percent in

any

region; however, this year more than two-thirds of respondents in nearly

every

region say their organizations are using AI.

1

Organizations based in Central and South America are the exception, with 58 percent of respondents working for organizations based in Central and South America reporting AI adoption.

Looking by industry, the biggest increase in adoption can be found in professional services.

2

Includes respondents working for organizations focused on human resources, legal services, management consulting, market research, R&D, tax preparation, and training.

Also, responses suggest that companies are now using AI in more parts of the business. Half of respondents say their organizations have adopted AI in two or more business functions, up from less than a third of respondents in 2023 (Exhibit 2).

Gen AI adoption is most common in the functions where it can create the most value

Most respondents now report that their organizationsâand they as individualsâare using gen AI. Sixty-five percent of respondents say their organizations are regularly using gen AI in at least one business function, up from one-third last year. The average organization using gen AI is doing so in two functions, most often in marketing and sales and in product and service developmentâtwo functions in which

previous research

Â determined that gen AI adoption could generate the most value

â

The economic potential of generative AI: The next productivity frontier

,â McKinsey, June 14, 2023.

âas well as in IT (Exhibit 3). The biggest increase from 2023 is found in marketing and sales, where reported adoption has more than doubled. Yet across functions, only two use cases, both within marketing and sales, are reported by 15 percent or more of respondents.

Gen AI also is weaving its way into respondentsâ personal lives. Compared with 2023, respondents are much more likely to be using gen AI at work and even more likely to be using gen AI both at work and in their personal lives (Exhibit 4). The survey finds upticks in gen AI use across all regions, with the largest increases in AsiaâPacific and Greater China. Respondents at the highest seniority levels, meanwhile, show larger jumps in the use of gen Al tools for work and outside of work compared with their midlevel-management peers. Looking at specific industries, respondents working in energy and materials and in professional services report the largest increase in gen AI use.

Investments in gen AI and analytical AI are beginning to create value

The latest survey also shows how different industries are budgeting for gen AI. Responses suggest that, in many industries, organizations are about equally as likely to be investing more than 5 percent of their digital budgets in gen AI as they are in nongenerative, analytical-AI solutions (Exhibit 5). Yet in most industries, larger shares of respondents report that their organizations spend more than 20 perc

## ✓ Google finds AI chatbots are only 69% accurate… at best - Digital Trends

**URL:** https://www.digitaltrends.com/computing/google-finds-ai-chatbots-are-only-69-accurate-at-best/

Google

has published a blunt assessment of how reliable today’s AI chatbots really are, and the numbers are not flattering. Using its newly introduced

FACTS Benchmark Suite

, the company found that even

the best AI models

struggle to break past a 70% factual accuracy rate. The top performer,

Gemini 3 Pro

, reached 69% overall accuracy, while other leading systems from

OpenAI

,

Anthropic

, and

xAI

scored even lower. The takeaway is simple and uncomfortable. These chatbots still get roughly one out of every three answers wrong,

even when they sound confident doing it

.

The benchmark matters because most existing

AI tests focus on whether a model can complete a task, not whether the information it produces is actually true

. For industries like finance, healthcare, and law, that gap can be costly. A fluent response that sounds confident but contains errors can do real damage, especially when users assume the chatbot knows what it is talking about.

What Google’s accuracy test reveals

Google

The FACTS Benchmark Suite was built by Google’s FACTS team with Kaggle to directly test factual accuracy across four real-world use. One test measures parametric knowledge, which checks whether a model can answer fact-based questions using only what it learned during training. Another evaluates search performance, testing how well models use web tools to retrieve accurate information. A third focuses on grounding, meaning whether the model sticks to a provided document without adding false details. The fourth examines multimodal understanding, such as reading charts, diagrams, and images correctly.

Google

The results show sharp differences between models. Gemini 3 Pro led the leaderboard with a 69% FACTS score, followed by Gemini 2.5 Pro and OpenAI’s

ChatGPT-5

nearly at 62% percent. Claude 4.5 Opus landed at ~51% percent, while Grok 4 scored ~54%. Multimodal tasks were the weakest area across the board, with accuracy often below 50%. This matters because these tasks involve reading charts, diagrams, or images, where a chatbot could confidently misread a sales graph or pull the wrong number from a document, leading to mistakes that are easy to miss but hard to undo.

The takeaway isn’t that chatbots are useless, but blind trust is risky. Google’s own data suggests AI is improving, yet it still needs verification, guardrails, and human oversight before it can be treated as a reliable source of truth.
